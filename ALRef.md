accessed by index. Contrary to the Array data type, a List is
unbounded, such that its dimension does not need to be
specified upon declaration.

Media Encapsulates media files, such as image .jpg and .png files, in
application database tables. The Media data type can be used as
a table field data type, but cannot be used as a variable or
parameter. The Media data type enables you to import a media
file to the application database and reference the file from
records, making it possible to display the media file in the client
user interface. You can also export media from the database to
files and streams.

# Array methods

Article•03/19/2024

An array is a data structure that contains many variables, which are accessed through
computed indices. An index is the location of the variable stored in an array. The
variables contained in an array are also called the elements of the array. The array
always stores elements of the same data type.

An array has a rank that determines the number of indices that is how long it takes to
reach an element. And if there are repeating elements, their rank is same as their first
occurrence in the array. The rank of an array is also referred to as the dimension of the
array. An array with a rank of one is called a single-dimensional array. An array with a
rank greater than one is called a multi-dimensional array. Specific sized multi-
dimensional arrays are often referred to as two-dimensional arrays, three-dimensional
arrays, and so on. Each dimension of an array has an associated length, which is an
integral number greater than or equal to zero. The maximum number of dimensions is
10 and the total number of elements in all dimensions is 1,000,000.

The length of a dimension determines the valid range of indices for that dimension. For
a dimension of length N, indices can range from **1 to N** inclusive. The total number of
elements in an array is the product of the lengths of each dimension in the array. If one
or more of the dimensions of an array have a length of zero, the array is considered to
be empty.

The syntax for declaring an array of a specific type is the following:

```
AL
```
The Dimension is a comma-delimited list of integer literals greater than 0, where each

integer defines the number of elements in that dimension.

The Type is the element type of the array.

## Syntax

```
array [Dimension] of Type;
```
## Code example


The following code sample shows the declaration of an array with a simple element
type.

```
AL
```
The following code sample shows the declaration of an array with an element type of a
fixed length.

```
AL
```
The following code sample shows the declaration of an array with a complex element
type.

```
AL
```
The following AL methods for arrays are available:

ArrayLen method
CompressArray method
CopyArray method

The following code sample shows the declaration of an array of temporary Item records:

```
AL
```
```
arrayOfInteger: array [ 10 ] of Integer;
```
```
arrayOfCode: array [ 10 ] of Code[ 20 ];
arrayOfText: array [ 10 ] of Text[ 20 ];
```
```
arrayOfCodeunits: array [ 10 ] of Codeunit 10 ;
arrayOfQueryes: array [ 10 ] of Query "My Query";
arrayOfTemporaryRecords: array [ 10 ] of Record 10 Temporary;
arrayOfDotNetVariables: array [10] of DotNet String;
```
### Methods

### Array of temporary records

```
itemRecArrayTemp: array[ 2 ] of Record Item temporary;
```

In this case, each element of the array contains a temporary Item record referencing the
same temporary table, meaning that an insert into itemRecArrayTemp[0] is also reflected
in itemRecArrayTemp[1].

This is the same behavior as using Copy(RecordRef [, Boolean]) with the ShareTable
parameter set to true.

# Essential AL methods

Article•11/25/2024

Although there are hundreds of methods in AL, there are several methods that you use
more often than the others. It doesn't mean that the rest of the methods are obsolete or
that you never use them. However, it does mean that if you're familiar with this small set
of essential methods, you are able to accomplish many tasks when you're programming
in AL. When you want to add more specialized functionality to your applications, you
can learn about more of the methods.

The articles in this section describe the most common AL methods. For more
information about all of the AL methods, see AL method reference.

```
Get, Find, and Next methods
SetCurrentKey, SetRange, SetFilter, GetRangeMin, and GetRangeMax methods
Insert, Modify, ModifyAll, Delete, and DeleteAll methods
LockTable method
Field Calculation methods
Progress Windows, Message, Error, and Confirm methods

# Get, Find, and Next methods

Article•04/17/2024

The following methods are used to search for records:

```
Get
Find
Next
```
These methods are some of the most frequently used AL methods. When you search for
records, you must know the difference between Get and Find. You should also know

how to use Find and Next in conjunction.

The Get method (Record) retrieves one record based on values of the primary key fields.

```
Get has the following syntax.
```
```
AL
```
For example, if the **No.** field is the primary key of the **Customer** table and if you've
created a record variable called **CustomerRec** that has a subtype of Customer, then you
can use Get in the following way.

```
AL
```
The result is that the record of customer 4711 is retrieved.

```
 Tip
```
```
When using these methods, consider using the partial records methods to improve
performance, especially when looping through several records or when table
extensions are defined on the table. For more information, see Using partial
records.
```
## Get method

```
[Ok :=] Record.Get([Value],...)
```
```
CustomerRec.Get('4711');
```

Get produces a runtime error if it fails and the return value isn't checked by the code. In
the previous example, the actual code that you write should resemble the following.

```
AL
```
Get searches for a record without changing any current filters. Get always searches
through all the records in a table.

```
APPLIES TO: Business Central 2019 release wave 2 and later
```
The GetBySystemId(Guid) retrieves a record based on the value of its **SystemId** field.

```
GetBySystemId has the following syntax:
```
```
AL
```
The following example gets the record that has the SystemId 5286305A-08A3-E911-8180-
001DD8B7338E:

```
AL
```
Similar to the Get method, GetBySystemId also searches for a record without changing

any current filters.

```
if CustomerRec.GET('4711') then
.... // Do some processing.
else
.... // Do some error processing.
```
### GetBySystemId method

```
RecordExists := Record.GetBySystemId(SystemId: Guid)
```
```
var
Customer: Record Customer;
Text000: Label 'Customer was found.';
begin
If Customer.GetBySystemId('{5286305A-08A3-E911-8180-001DD8B7338E}') then
Message(Text000);
end;
```
### Find methods


The Find method (Record) locates a record in a table that is based on the values stored
in the keys.

```
Find has the following syntax.
```
```
AL
```
The _Which_ parameter specifies how to perform the search. You can search for values
that are greater than, less than, or equal to the key value, or for the first or last record in
a table.

The important differences between Get and Find are as follows:

```
Find uses the current filters.
```
```
Find can look for records where the key value is equal to, greater than, or smaller
than the search string.
```
```
Find can find the first or the last record, depending on the sort order defined by
the current key.
```
When you're developing applications in a relational database, there are often one-to-
many relationships defined between tables. An example could be the relationship
between an **Item** table, which registers items, and a **Sales Line** table, which registers the
detailed lines from sales orders. One record in the **Sales Line** table can only be related
to one item, but each item can be related to any number of sales line records. You won't
want an item record to be deleted as long as there are still open sales orders that
include the item. You can use Find to check for open sales orders.

If you want to find the first record in a table or set, then use the FindFirst method
(Record). If you want to find the last record in a table or set, then use the FindLast
method (Record).

The PickItem procedure of the **Item** table includes the following code that illustrates
using FindFirst.

```
AL
```
```
Ok := Record.Find([Which])
```
```
procedure PickItem(var Item: Record Item): Code[ 20 ]
var
ItemList: Page "Item List";
begin
if Item.FilterGroup = - 1 then
```

#### Feedback

The Next method (Record) is often used with FIND to step through the records of a
table.

```
Next has the following syntax.
```
```
AL
```
In the following example, Find is used to go to the first record of the table. Next is used

to step through every record, until there are no more. When there are no more records,
Next returns a 0 (zero).

```
AL
```
AL methods
SystemId field

```
ItemList.SetTempFilteredItemRec(Item);
if Item.FindFirst() then;
ItemList.SetTableView(Item);
ItemList.SetRecord(Item);
ItemList.LookupMode := true;
if ItemList.RunModal() = ACTION::LookupOK then
ItemList.GetRecord(Item)
else
Clear(Item);
```
```
exit(Item."No.");
end;
```
### Next method

```
Steps := Record.Next([Steps])
```
```
if (Rec.FindSet) then
repeat
// process record
until (Rec.Next = 0 );
```

# Create Handler Methods

Article•08/16/2022

You can create test codeunits, test methods, and test pages to test your application. We
recommend that you create tests that can be automated. To create automated tests, you
must write code to handle all UI interactions so that the tests don't require user
interaction when they're running. To do this, you create special handler methods.

You can use the following handler methods:

```
Method type Purpose Signature
MessageHandler Handles Message statements. < Function name >
(< Message >: Text[1024])
```
```
ConfirmHandler Handles Confirm statements. < Function name >
(< Question >: Text[1024];
var < Reply >: Boolean)
StrMenuHandler Handles StrMenu statements. < Function name >
(< Options : Text[1024];
var < Choice >: Integer;
<Instruction>:
Text[1024])
```
```
PageHandler Handles specific pages that aren't run
modally.
```
```
< Function name >(var
<Page>: Page < page
id >)
```
```
< Function name >(var
<Page>: TestPage
< testpage id >)
```
```
ModalPageHandler Handles specific pages that are run
modally.
```
```
< Function name >(var
<Page>: Page < page
id >; var <Response>:
Action)
```
```
< Function name >(var
<Page>: Page < testpage
id >)
ReportHandler Handles specific reports. If you create a
ReportHandler method, then that method
```
```
< Function name >(var
<Report>: Report
```
```
ﾉ Expand table
```

```
Method type Purpose Signature
replaces all code for running the report,
including the request page, and a
RequestPageHandler isn't called. Only
create a RequestPageHandler if you aren't
using a ReportHandler.
```
```
< report id >)
```
```
FilterPageHandler Handles a specific filter page. The
FilterPageHandler tests the UI that is
generated by a FilterPageBuilder Data
Type.
```
```
< Function name >(var
<Record1>: RecordRef)[,
var <Record2>:
RecordRef] [, ...]):
Boolean
RequestPageHandler Handles the request page of a specific
report.
```
```
< Function name >(var
<RequestPage>:
TestRequestPage)
HyperlinkHandler Handles specific hyperlinks. < Function name >
(<Hyperlink>:
Text[1024])
SendNotificationHandler Handles Send statements. < Function name >
(< TheNotification >:
Notification): Boolean
RecallNotificationHandler Handles Recall statements. < Function name >
(< TheNotification >:
Notification): Boolean
SessionSettingsHandler Handles RequestSessionUpdate
statements.
```
```
< Function name >(var
< SessionSettings >:
SessionSettings):
Boolean
```
To create a handler method, you set one of the handler attributes on a method. You
must use the method signature specified for the handler attribute that you're using, as
illustrated in this code example.

```
AL
```
### How to create a handler method

```
[MessageHandler]
procedure MessageHandler(Message: Text[ 1024 ])
begin
Assert.IsTrue(StrPos(Message, MSG_HAS_BEEN_CREATED) > 0 , Message);
end;
```

#### Feedback

The parameters of the methods that are being handled are passed as parameters to the
handler methods. For example, when **Message** is called in a test method, the parameter
of the **Message** method is passed as the parameter of the **MessageHandler** method. For
page and report handlers, the page, report, or request page is passed as the parameter
of the **PageHandler** , **ModalPageHandler** , **ReportHandler** , or **RequestPageHandler**.

You can call handler methods from methods that have the Test Attribute and then
specify the handler methods that it will use in the HandlerFunctions Attribute. The code
inside the test method should simulate that the UI was actually raised and some values
entered or some actions were taken. You can specify more than one handler method by
separating the handler method names with a comma.

The following example shows a test method that uses the HandlerFunctions Attribute to
call the **MessageHandler** method.

```
AL
```
Testing the Application
AL Methods

```
７ Note
```
```
Every handler method that you enter in the HandlerFunctions Attribute of a test
method must be called at least one time in the test method. If you run a test
method that has a handler method listed that isn't called, then the test fails.
```
```
[Test]
[HandlerFunctions('MessageHandler')]
procedure ApproveRequestForPurchCreditMemo()
var
PurchHeader: Record "Purchase Header";
begin
ApproveRequestForPurchDocument(PurchHeader."Document Type"::"Credit
Memo");
end;
```

# Handling errors using try methods

Article•11/14/2024

Try methods in AL enable you to handle errors that occur in the application during code
execution. For example, with try methods, you can provide more user-friendly error
messages to the end user than errors thrown by the system.

The main purpose of try methods is to catch errors/exceptions thrown by the Business
Central AL platform. For on-premises, they can catch exceptions thrown during .NET
Framework interoperability operations. Try methods catch errors similar to a conditional
Codeunit. Except for the try method, the Run method call doesn't require that write
transactions are committed to the database, and changes to the database that are made
with a try method aren't rolled back.

Because changes made to the database by a try method aren't rolled back, you
shouldn't include database write transactions within a try method. For Business Central
online, there are no restrictions on performing write transactions in try methods. For
Business Central on-premises, the Business Central Server prevents database write
transactions within try methods by default. If a try method contains a database write
transaction, a runtime error occurs. You can allow write transactions by setting the
DisableWriteInsideTryFunctions parameter in the Business Central Server configuration

to false. Learn more about configuring the server in Configure Business Central Server.
This behavior might change in an upcoming release.

A method that is designated as a try method has a Boolean return value ( **true** or **false** ),
and has the construction OK:= MyTrymethod. A try method can't have a user-defined

return value.

```
７ Note
```
```
Try Methods are available from runtime version 2.0.
```
## Behavior and usage

## Database write transactions in try methods

## Handling errors with a return value


```
If a try method call doesn't use the return value, the try method operates like an
ordinary method, and errors are exposed as usual.
If a try method call uses the return value in an OK:= statement or a conditional
statement such as if-then, errors are caught. The try method returns true if no
error occurs; false if an error occurs.
```
You can use the GetLastErrorText method to obtain errors generated by Business
Central. To get details of exceptions generated by the AL platform or by .NET objects,
you can use the GetLastErrorObject method to inspect the Exception.InnerException

property.

To create a try method, add a method in the AL code of an object such as a codeunit,
and then set the TryFunction Attribute.

The following simple example illustrates how the try method works. First, create a
codeunit that has a local method MyTrymethod. Add the following code on the OnRun

trigger and MyTrymethod method.

```
AL
```
```
AL
```
```
７ Note
```
```
The return value isn't accessible within the try method itself.
```
###### Getting details about errors

### Creating a try method

### Example

```
trigger OnRun()
begin
MyTrymethod;
message('Everything went well');
end;
```
```
local procedure MyTryMethod()
begin
```

#### Feedback

When you run this codeunit, the execution of the OnRun trigger stops. The error

message An error occurred during the operation is thrown in the UI.

Now, set the TryFunction Attribute of the MyTrymethod method. Then, add code to the
OnRun trigger to handle the return value of the try method:

```

# Progress Windows, Message, Error, and

# Confirm Methods

Article•12/22/2023

You can use several specialized methods to display messages and gather input. We
recommend that you use pages to ensure that your application has a consistent user
interface. However, there are situations where you may want to use the dialog methods
instead of pages. The most important uses of the dialog methods are as follows:

```
To display a window that indicates the progress of some processing that may take
a long time.
```
```
To stop the running program to display an error message.
```
```
To let the user confirm a choice before the program continues running.
```
You can also use the StrMenu method to create pages that present options to the user.
It's much faster to use this method than to design a page, which only presents a limited
set of options to the user. For more information about the StrMenu method, see
StrMenu Method.

We recommend the following guidelines for writing messages for end users:

```
Write messages correctly according to the grammatical rules for your language.
```
```
Don't use backslashes to indicate line breaks in a message. Line formatting is
completed automatically. The only exception is in the Open Method). You must use
backslashes for the message to be aligned correctly.
```
```
Use the FieldCaption Method) and TableCaption Method) whenever possible to
return names of fields and tables as strings. It's so that the user can always
recognize a term that indicates a field or table name. The only exception to this is
in Open Method) where you can use the field name directly. Otherwise, it can be
difficult to align correctly. If you refer to a field name without using the
FieldCaption method, then type the field name without any single or double
quotation marks.
```
```
Try to write all messages on only one line. If you want to use more than one line,
then start a new line after a period instead of in the middle of a sentence.
```
## Best practices for user messages


```
Don't enter the text directly in the AL code. Instead, enter it as a label so that the
message can be translated.
```
If you have an application whose processing can take a long time to complete, then you
should consider displaying a window that informs the user of the progress that is being
made. It's always a good idea to inform the user that processes are still running.

A **Cancel** button is automatically added to every dialog window and gives user the
opportunity to stop the processing.

In some applications, you may want to create a window in which each field is updated
when the program is running. For example, the fields in the window, display the count of
the postings made. In another application, you may want to display information about
the record that is currently being processed. For example, the field in the window,
displays the number of the account that is currently being processed.

To create this kind of progress window, you use the Dialog data type.

The Message Method) displays a message in a window that remains open until the user
chooses the **OK** button.

The Message method has the following syntax.

```
AL
```
The Message method runs asynchronously, which means that the message isn't run until
the method from which it was called ends or another method requests user input. The
method is useful for notifying the user that some processing has been successfully
completed.

For an example of the Message method, see codeunit 83 in the CRONUS International
Ltd. demonstration database. The code in the OnRun trigger converts a quote into a
sales order and then displays a message. The message is generated by the following
code.

```
AL
```
### Creating a window to indicate progress

### Message method

```
message(String [, Value1, ...]);
```

The Error Method is similar to the Message method except that when the user has
acknowledged the message from an Error method, AL execution ends. The Error

method is also similar to the FieldError method. For more information on the FieldError

method, see CalcFields, CalcSums, FieldError, FieldName, Init, TestField, and Validate
Methods.

The Error method has the following syntax:

```
AL
```
For more information about error handling in AL, see Error handling overview.

```
var
Text001 : Label 'Quote %1 has been changed to order %2';
message(Text001,"No.",SalesHeader2."No.");
```
```
７ Note
```
```
Unlike the progress window, the Message method doesn't require that you first
declare a variable of the type Dialog. The Message method creates a window of its
own.
```
### Error method

```
procedure MyProc()
var
MyErrorInfo: ErrorInfo;
begin
// setup ErrorInfo
MyErrorInfo.Title('Error message title that the user sees.');
MyErrorInfo.Message('Error message the user sees.');
MyErrorInfo.DetailedMessage('(Hidden) error details for the person who
needs to troubleshoot.');
// add more properties for ErrorInfo depending on the scenario
Error(MyErrorInfo);
```
```
// no more AL code runs after the Error method
end;
```
### Confirm method

The Confirm Method) is used just like the Message method to display a message.

However, unlike the Message method, the Confirm method has a required return value.

The Confirm method has the following syntax.

```
AL
```
The following example shows how to use the Confirm method.

```
AL
```
The false parameter in the confirm statement means that No is the default.

# Create Test Codeunits and Test Methods

Article•08/16/2022

In Dynamics 365 Business Central, you can create test codeunits and then test methods
in the test codeunits.

Test codeunits are codeunits that have the SubType Property set to **Test**. You write tests
as AL code in the methods inside of the test codeunits. There are three types of
methods that you can add in a test codeunit: test, handler, and normal. Each method
type is used for a specific purpose and behaves differently. When a test codeunit runs, it
runs the **OnRun** trigger, and then runs each test method in the codeunit.

By default, each test method runs in a separate database transaction, but you can use
the TransactionModel Attribute on test methods and the TestIsolation Property on test
runner codeunits to control the transactional behavior.

The results of a test codeunit and of the individual test methods are displayed in a
message window, but you can use the OnAfterTestRun Trigger on a test runner codeunit
to capture the results. The outcome of a test method is either SUCCESS or FAILURE. If
any error is raised by either the code that is being tested or the test code, then the
global outcome of the test codeunit is FAILURE and the error is included in the results
log file.

The difference between a normal codeunit and a test codeunit is their execution at
runtime. When a normal codeunit is run, if one of its methods fails, then the codeunit is
terminated. When a test codeunit is run, even if the outcome of one test method is
FAILURE, the next test methods are still running.

The methods in a test codeunit can be one of the following types:

```
Type Description
```
```
Test
method
```
```
You use test methods that include AL code that tests the business logic in the
application, where each method covers a transaction. You declare the Test Attribute on
the method.
```
```
Handler
method
```
```
You use handler methods to automate tests by handling instances when user
interaction is required by the code that is being tested by the test method. In these
instances, the handler method is run instead of the requested user interface. The
handler method should simulate the user interaction for the test case, such as
validating messages, making selections, or entering values. You declare a handler type
attribute on the method. For more information, see Create Handler Methods
```

# Procedure overload

Article•11/25/2024

Procedure overload enables developers to create multiple procedures with the same
name, but with different signatures, on the same application object. Conceptually,
overloaded procedures are used to execute the same task on a different set of
arguments. When an overloaded procedure is called, a specific implementation of that
procedure, appropriate to the context of the call, will be run.

Overloaded procedures give programmers the flexibility to call a procedure with similar
semantics for different types of data. At the same time, overloaded procedures remove
the need for abusing the Variant data type for the purpose of processing different types
of data in a similar manner and allows the developer to write strongly-typed code and
rely on the compiler for validation.

Overload resolution is performed by using procedure signatures to find the best match.
The signature of a procedure is represented by its name and the type, order, and
number of parameters. The return type of a procedure is not part of the procedure’s
signature.

The following example shows how a **ToString** method can be implemented with and
without using procedure overloads.
In the first code snippet, a **ToString** procedure is implemented. This takes a Variant value
and inspects the type of the value to delegate to different implementations. If the caller
passes a value of a different type than Integer, Date, and Text, an empty string will be
returned. This can lead to bugs that will only show up at runtime.

```
AL
```
## Reasons for using procedure overload

## Remarks

## Example

```
codeunit 10 Stringifier
{
local procedure TextToString(value : Text) : Text
begin
Exit(value);
end;
```

In the second code snippet, we overload the ToString procedure for Text, Date and
Integer. At this point, it is not possible for a caller to call a ToString method with a
different type other than Integer, Date, or Text. This will catch the bug above at compile
time.

```
AL
```
```
local procedure DateToString(value : Date) : Text
begin
Exit(Format(value));
end;
local procedure IntegerToString(value : Integer) : Text
begin
Exit(Format(value));
end;
```
```
procedure ToString(value: Variant) : Text
begin
if value.IsInteger then
Exit(IntegerToString(value))
else if value.IsDate then
Exit(DateToString(value))
else if value.IsText then
Exit(TextToString(value))
else
Exit('');
end;
}
```
```
codeunit 10 StringifierWithOverloads
{
procedure ToString(value : Text) : Text
begin
Exit(value);
end;
procedure ToString(value : Date) : Text
begin
Exit(Format(value));
end;
procedure ToString(value : Integer) : Text
begin
Exit(Format(value));
end;
}
```

# Joker data type

Article•11/25/2024

The Joker data type is an _internal_ data type that isn't exposed to AL developers. Joker
can replace any other type and represents a wildcard. In certain cases, Joker plays the

role of a generic T which is inferred from the type of the left-hand side of the invocation
expression, in other cases, it is inferred from another parameter.

The following illustrates examples of how Joker is used in AL.

```

Boolean Assumes the values true or false. When formatted, a Boolean field is shown as
"Yes" or "No". The size of the corresponding SQL data type, TINYINT, is 1 byte.
Integer Denotes an integer between -2,147,483,647 and 2,147,483,647. The size of the
corresponding SQL data type, INTEGER, is 4 bytes.
```
```
BigInteger A 64-bit integer.
Decimal A decimal number between -10^63 and 10^63. The exponent ranges from -63 to
```
63. Decimal numbers are held in memory with 18 significant digits. The
representation of a decimal number is a Binary Coded Decimal (BCD). The size of
the corresponding SQL data type, DECIMAL(38,20), is 17 bytes. We recommend
that you construct decimals that operate on numbers in the range of +/-
999,999,999,999,999.99. You can construct larger numbers in some cases, but
overflow, truncation or loss of precision can occur.
Option An option field is defined by using an option string, which is a comma-separated
list of strings that represent each valid value of the field. This string is used when a
field of type Option is formatted and its value is converted into a string.
Text Any alphanumeric string. The field must be defined to be between 1 and 2048
characters. The number of bytes used by a text field equals (number of characters
+ 1) * 2. The additional character is used for the string terminating character,
which is '0' in Unicode. The size of a Unicode character is 2 bytes. Therefore, you
multiply the number of characters by two to get the size.

```
Code An alphanumeric string, which is right-justified if the contents are numbers only. If
letters or blanks occur among the numbers, the contents are left-aligned. All
letters are converted to uppercase upon entry. The field must be defined to be
between 1 and 2048 characters.

# TestPermissions Option Type

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Specifies a value that can be used to determine which permission sets are used on tests
that are run by test codunits or test functions.

```
Member Description
```
```
InheritFromTestCodeunit Is only relevant for test methods; not test codeunits. It specifies that a
test method uses the TestPermissions property setting of the test
codeunit to which it belongs. If you use this value on a test codunit,
the property will resolve to Restrictive at runtime.
Restrictive This is the default value. Setting the Restrictive value will cause the
permission execution context of every test in the codeunit to be set by
default to 'D365 Full Access’. It is required to lower the level of
permissions within every test to any permission sets other than 'D365
Full Access’. Otherwise, it will result in a runtime error. The change of
the permission execution context is supported by Codeunit "Library -
Lower Permissions".
NonRestrictive Setting the NonRestrictive value will cause that the permission
execution context of every test in the codeunit is set to 'D365 Full
Access’. Opposite to Restrictive, setting the TestPermissions property
to NonRestrictive does not require a change of permissions.
Disabled Setting this value will exclude any change of the permission execution
context and all tests will be executed using SUPER.

# TransactionType Option Type

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Represents a transaction type.

```
Member Description
UpdateNoLocks This is an update transaction. Modifications can occur within the transaction. All
read operations are performed with READ UNCOMMITTED locking until the
table is either modified by a write operation or locked with the LOCKTABLE
Method (Record). From this point until the end of the transaction, all read
operations are performed with UpdLock locking. This transaction type improves
concurrency for all tables that users access within the transaction by delaying
locking as much as it can. However, the disadvantage is that you must know
when to lock the tables for the required transaction behavior.
```
```
Update This is an update transaction. Modifications can occur within the transaction. All
read operations are performed with REPEATABLE READ locking until the table is
either modified by any write operation or locked with the LOCKTABLE method.
From this point forward, all read operations are performed with UpdLock
locking. This transaction type provides full transaction isolation from the start
of the transaction, regardless of the lock status of tables that users access
within the transaction.
```
```
Snapshot This is a read-only transaction. Modifications cannot occur within the
transaction. All read operations are performed with REPEATABLE READ locking.
Therefore, shared locks are added on all data and are maintained until the end
of the transaction. This prevents other transactions from modifying any rows
that have been read by the current transaction.
Browse This is a read-only transaction. Modifications cannot occur within the
transaction. All read operations are performed with READ UNCOMMITTED
locking. Therefore, no locks are added and locks that are added by other
sessions are not honored. This means that the transaction may read
uncommitted data.
```
```
Report Report option maps to one of the basic options. This enables a report to use
the most concurrent read-only form of data access for the connected server.

# BigInteger Data type

9,223,372,036,854,775,807.

This data type is a 64-bit integer.

You must add an L to the constant definition to inform AL that the integer must be
interpreted and treated as a BigInteger.

If you assign -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 directly to a BigInteger variable, then you get
an error when you try to compile the code. However, you can indirectly assign
-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to a BigInteger variable by using the following code.

```

If you try to indirectly assign a value that is smaller than -9,223,372,036,854,775,808, or
larger than 9,223,372,036,854,775,807, then you get a run-time error.

# BigText.AddText(Text [, Integer])

# Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Adds a text string to a BigText variable.

```
AL
```
_BigText_
Type: BigText
An instance of the BigText data type.

_String_
Type: Text
The string that will be added to the BigText variable. If this parameter is empty, then the
BigText variable is not modified.

_[Optional] Position_
Type: Integer
This is an optional parameter that defines the position in the BigText variable where the
string is inserted. If this parameter is omitted, then the string is added at the end of the
BigText variable. If this parameter is less than one, then a run-time error occurs. If this
parameter is greater than the length of the BigText variable, then the string is added at
the end of the BigText variable.

_Variable_ can be inserted anywhere in _BigText_ or added at the end of the _BigText_.

The first character in a _BigText_ variable is position 1.

## Syntax

```
BigText.AddText(String: Text [, Position: Integer])
```
## Parameters

## Remarks


To delete the content in a _BigText_ variable, use the Clear Method. The following code
shows the syntax for the method: Clear(BigText)

The following examples show how to use the AddText method. The specified text is
inserted into the BigText string at the specified position. In these examples, the initial
content of the _BigText_ variable is ABCDEFG. These examples require that you create the

following variable.

```
AL
```
The following example inserts the string 'ZZZ' after the character B in the MyBigText
variable because 3 is specified for _Position_.

```
AL
```
The following example appends the string 'ZZZ' at the end of the MyBigText variable
because the number specified for _Position_ is greater than the length of the MyBigText
variable.

```
７ Note
```
```
If you use AddText to add multiple BigText strings to what is presented as a single
string, you can experience performance problems. The same applies to other
repetitive uses of AddText. This is due to the implementation of the BigText data
type, which relies on a String object that is immutable. You can avoid this issue by
refactoring the code to reduce the number of additions or deletions. Alternatively,
you can change your implementation to use the System.Text.StringBuilder class
instead. For more information, see Immutability and the StringBuilder Class in the
MSDN Library.
```
### Example 1

```
var
MyBigText: BigText;
```
```
// Example 1
MyBigText.AddText('ABCDEFG');

_BigText_
Type: BigText
An instance of the BigText data type.

_Variable_
Type: Text
The sub text of the BigText that is retrieved. This is the actual text that is returned.

_Position_
Type: Integer
The position in the BigText variable that the sub text is to be retrieved from. If this
parameter is less than one, then a run-time error occurs. If this parameter is greater than
the length of the BigText variable, then an empty string is returned. If the value of this
parameter plus the value of the Length parameter is greater than the length of the
BigText variable, then the remainder of the BigText variable from the position specified
by this parameter is returned.

_[Optional] Length_
Type: Integer
The length of the sub text that should be retrieved. This parameter is optional. If this
parameter is omitted the function retrieves a sub text that starts at Position and runs to
the end of the BigText variable. If this parameter is less than 0, then a run-time error

## Syntax

```
[Length := ] BigText.GetSubText(var Variable: Text, Position: Integer [,
Length: Integer])
```
## Parameters


occurs. If the value of the Position parameter plus the value of this parameter is greater
than the length of the BigText variable, then the remainder of the BigText variable from
the position specified by this parameter is returned.

_[Optional] Length_
Type: Integer
The length of the result text.

The first character in a BigText variable is position 1.

To delete the content in a BigText variable use the Clear Method. The following code
snippet shows the syntax for the clear method. Clear(BigText).

The following examples demonstrate how to use the GetSubText method. This example
requires that you create the following global variables and text constant.

```
AL
```
The following example initializes the content of the MyBigText variable with the text
ABCDEFG. The method starts from the third position (the character C) in the MyBigText
variable and retrieves two characters. The result is the subtext CD. This is because the
number 2 is specified for _Length_.

```
AL
```
### Return Value

### Remarks

### Example 1

```
var
MyBigText: BigText;
VarSubText: Text;
Text000: Label 'VarSubText = %1';
```
```
MyBigText.AddText('ABCDEFG');
MyBigText.GetSubText(VarSubText, 3 , 2 ); // Returns CD.
Message(Text000, VarSubText);

Stores a single, 8-bit character as a value in the range 0 to 255. You can easily convert
this data type from a number to a character and vice versa. This means you can use
mathematical operators on Byte variables.

The following example assumes that you have a Byte variable named B and a Text
variable named S.

You can assign a constant string of the length 1 to a Byte variable, as shown in the first
line of the following code example. You can assign a single character in a Text or Code
variable to a Byte variable, as shown in the second line of the following code example.
You can assign a numeric value to a Byte variable, as shown in the third line of the
following code example. This causes the Byte variable to contain the character from the
ASCII character set that corresponds to the numeric ASCII code.

```
AL
```
You cannot assign a character to a position greater than the position of the null
terminator. For example, if the value of the text variable _MyText_ is 'abc', then the null
terminator is at position 4 and the following assignment causes a run-time error to
occur.

# Code Data type

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Denotes a special type of string that is converted to uppercase and removes any trailing
or leading spaces.

The length of a Code variable equals the number of characters in the text without
leading or trailing spaces.

You must specify the length of a Code variable or field. The maximum length of a Code
variable is 1024 characters. The maximum length of a Code field in a table is 2048
characters. A Code variable cannot be null. The Code data type supports Unicode.

You can index any character position in a string, such as A[65]. The resulting value will be
a Char Data Type. You cannot assign a char to a position in the code variable greater
than the current length of the variable +1.

Fields that contain a date formula must not have data type Code. Instead, use the
DateFormula Data Type. All fields that contain a date formula with data type Code must
be converted into data type DateFormula.

This example shows some typical examples of code string assignments. In these
examples, assume that the variable c is a code variable with a maximum length of 4.

```
AL
```
## Remarks

## Example

```
c := 'ABC';
// Results in variable c, which contains 'ABC'
// and is 3 characters in length.
c := '1';
// Results in variable c, which contains '1'
// and is 1 character in length.
c := '';
// Results in variable c, which contains '' (empty string)
// and is zero (0) characters in length.
c := ' 2 ';

# Codeunit.Run(Integer [, var Record])

# Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Loads and runs the unit of AL code you specify. To use this method, you can specify a
table associated with the codeunit when you defined the codeunit properties. This
allows you to pass a variable with the method. The transaction that the codeunit
contains is always committed due to the Boolean return value.

```
AL
```
_Number_
Type: Integer
An integer data type that identifies the unit of AL code. If the codeunit you specify does
not exist, a run-time error occurs. If you run the codeunit with a record from a table
other than the one it is associated with, a run-time error occurs.

_[Optional] Record_
Type: Record
This optional parameter identifies a record. This parameter is a record data type.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] Codeunit.Run(Number: Integer [, var Record: Record])
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Transaction semantics

When the return value of the Codeunit.Run method is used, for example using the if

Codeunit.Run() then pattern, any changes done to the database will be committed at

the end of the codeunit, unless an error occurs. If you're already in a transaction you
must commit first before calling Codeunit.Run.

Using the CommitBehavior attribute together with Codeunit.Run, the implicit commit by

Codeunit.Run isn't affected by CommitBehavior. For more information, see
CommitBehavior Attribute.

This example runs two codeunits. The first uses a record parameter. The second is
defined without a source table.

Provides access to common database functionality.

The following methods are available on the Database data type.

```
Method name Description
```
```
AlterKey(KeyRef, Boolean) Alter a table's key in SQL, either disabling
or enabling it. Any alteration only pertains
to the current transaction and will be
reverted at the end of the current
transaction. Any alteration will fail if it's
called on System or non-SQL based tables.
Disabling clustered or unique keys is also
not supported and will fail at runtime.
ChangeUserPassword(Text, Text) Changes the password for the current
user.
```
```
CheckLicenseFile(Integer) Checks a key in the license file of the
system.
```
```
Commit() Ends the current write transaction.
CompanyName() Gets the current company name.
```
```
CopyCompany(Text, Text) Creates a new company and copies all
data from an existing company in the
same database.
```
```
CurrentTransactionType([TransactionType]) Gets the current transaction type and sets
a new type to be assigned.
DataFileInformation(Boolean, var Text, var Text, var
Boolean, var Boolean, var Boolean, var Text, var
DateTime, var Record)
```
```
Specifies data from a file that has been
exported from a database.
```
```
ExportData(Boolean, var Text [, Text] [, Boolean] [, Exports data from the database to a file.
```
## Static methods

```
ﾉ Expand table
```

**Method name Description**

Boolean] [, Boolean] [, Record]) The data is not deleted from the database.

GetDefaultTableConnection(TableConnectionType) Gets the default table connection based
on the specified connection type. You
must already have registered a table
connection of this type.

HasTableConnection(TableConnectionType, Text) Verifies if a connection to an external
database exists based on the specified
name.

ImportData(Boolean, var Text [, Boolean] [, Boolean]
[, Record])

```
Imports data from a file that has been
exported from a database.
```
IsInWriteTransaction() Checks whether or not you are in a write
transaction.

LastUsedRowVersion() Gets the last used RowVersion from the
database.

LockTimeout([Boolean]) Determines whether the lock time-out
setting is set to On. You can also use this
method to override the default setting.

MinimumActiveRowVersion() Returns the lowest active RowVersion in
the database. This is the lowest
RowVersion for an uncomitted row,
meaning rows with a lower timestamp
than this value are guaranteed to be
comitted. If there are no active
transactions, this value is equal to
LastUsedRowVersion + 1.

RegisterTableConnection(TableConnectionType, Text,
Text)

```
Registers a table connection to an external
database.
```
SelectLatestVersion() Forces the latest version of the database
to be used.

SelectLatestVersion(Integer) Ensures that the table's latest version is
used, ignoring any cached values older
than the method's call time.

SerialNumber() Gets a string that contains the serial
number of the license file for your system.

ServiceInstanceId() Gets the ID of the service instance.

SessionId() Gets the ID of the current session.


```
Method name Description
SetDefaultTableConnection(TableConnectionType,
Text [, Boolean])
```
```
Establishes a connection to an external
database based on a previously registered
connection of the specified type.
SetUserPassword(Guid, Text) Sets a password for the user iwith the
given user security ID. If the given
password is blank, an empty string will be
stored instead of a password hash. This
will prevent the user from logging in using
a password. Only SUPER can call this
method. Passwords cannot be set for the
empty GUID or for the default Super ID.
SID([Text]) Retrieves the security identifier (SID) of a
Windows user account.
TenantId() Gets the ID of the tenant that has started
the current session. Use this method when
your code must be specific about which
tenant database to access in a multitenant
deployment. For example, if your code
imports data into a cache, you can make a
cache tenant-specific by using the tenant
ID as a key. Also, if you want to write code
that saves documents, you can include the
tenant ID in the file name or location, for
example. In those cases, you can use the
TENANTID method in combination with
the COMPANYNAME method to identify
the company and the tenant database.
```
```
UnregisterTableConnection(TableConnectionType,
Text)
```
```
Unregisters a table connection to an
external database.
```
```
UserId() Gets the user name of the user account
that is logged on to the current session.
UserSecurityId() Gets the unique identifier of the user that
is logged on to the current session.

# Database.Commit() Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Ends the current write transaction.

```
AL
```
During AL code execution, if a transaction is needed, the AL runtime automatically
initializes it. At the completion of AL code execution, any transactions that are created
are also automatically ended, committing any updates made by the AL code.

This means that if you want code execution to perform a single write transaction, it's
automatically handled for you. However, if you want the code execution to perform
multiple write transactions, you must use the Commit method to end one write

transaction before you can start the next. The Commit method separates write
transactions in an AL code module.

The following pseudo-code example contains two write transactions. When it begins, a
write transaction is automatically started. Using the Commit method, you end the first
write transaction and prepare for the second. When the code completes, the second
write transaction automatically ends.

## Syntax

```
Database.Commit()

This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.

**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

Links and notes on records are not copied to the new company.

With versions 17.5 and later, errors in COPYCOMPANY can't be trapped. This change
prevents a company from being partially copied when an error occurs and it's followed
by a COMMIT(). Any error in COPYCOMPANY ends the execution flow, even with
statements like: IF NOT CopyCompany(.., ..) THEN. Also, any COMMIT() in triggers or

event subscribers is ignored.

The following example is based on the **Copy Company** batch job, which is part of the
CRONUS. The batch job takes the Company system table as a data item and uses the
**Name** field as the value of the _SourceName_ parameter. The value of the
_DestinationName_ parameter is specified in the **New Company Name** field in the request
page, which is represented by the NewCompanyName variable.

# Database.CurrentTransactionType([Trans

# actionType]) Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Gets the current transaction type and sets a new type to be assigned.

```
AL
```
_[Optional] TransactionType_
Type: TransactionType
The type of transaction to be set for the next transaction.

_[Optional] TransactionType_
Type: TransactionType
The type of transaction for the next transaction.

## Syntax

```
[TransactionType := ] Database.CurrentTransactionType([TransactionType:
TransactionType])
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked using property access syntax.
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
```
## Parameters

## Return Value


This method sets the transaction type for the next transaction that starts when you are
using Microsoft SQL Server. The transaction type determines the extent of locking that is
performed on data in SQL Server tables and indexes. It also determines whether
modifications to data can occur within the transaction. The following basic transaction
types are available:

```
Browse
Snapshot
UpdateNoLocks
Update
Report
```
The Report transaction type maps to one of the other basic transaction types. For more
information about the behavior of the transaction types, see TransactionType Property.

Using CurrentTransactionType to set a transaction type from within a currently active
transaction does not affect the transaction type. You must set the transaction type
before a transaction starts, which occurs at the first database call in a trigger or in a
codeunit. If you set the current transaction type to a less isolated transaction behavior,
for example, if you try to change an Update transaction to a Browse transaction, the
method call is ignored. If you try to change the current transaction type to a more
isolated transaction behavior, for example, from Browse to Update, you will receive an
error message.

In Example 1, CurrentTransactionType is used to set the required behavior of the next
transaction in the database.

```
AL
```
In Example 2, CurrentTransactionType is used to return the transaction type setting for
the current transaction.

### Remarks

### Example 1

```
//Example 1
CurrentTransactionType := TransactionType::UpdateNoLocks;
```
### Example 2


```
AL
```
Examples 3 and 4 show how to use the CurrentTransactionType method to set the
transaction type for two separate transactions.

When you set the transaction type as in Example 3, you will get an update (or write)
transaction using Serializable behavior, which means that modifications are allowed
within this transaction. SQL Server will guarantee the serializability of the transaction by
placing the appropriate locks when you read from the table in the database.

Examples 3 and 4 show how to use the CurrentTransactionType method to set the
transaction type for two separate transactions.

When you set the transaction type as in Example 4, you will get a read-only, non-locking
transaction. This means that no modifications are allowed within this transaction and
that SQL Server does not add any locks. It is also possible to read any uncommitted
data.

In Example 5, the initial transaction type is UpdateNoLocks. This is usually the default
transaction type for a trigger. When you try to change the transaction type from
UpdateNoLocks to Browse, which is a less isolated transaction type, the method call is
ignored. The current transaction type remains UpdateNoLocks. After the first Table.Get

```
//Example 2
if CurrentTransactionType = TransactionType::UpdateNoLocks then...
```
### Example 3

```
//Example 3
CurrentTransactionType := TransactionType::Update;
```
### Example 4

```
//Example 4
CurrentTransactionType := TransactionType::Browse;
```
### Example 5


line, again, when you try to change the transaction type from UpdateNoLocks to Browse,
the method call is ignored. The current transaction type remains UpdateNoLocks. Next,
when you try to change the transaction type from UpdateNoLocks to Update, which is a
more isolated transaction type, the method call causes an error message to be
generated. The current transaction type remains UpdateNoLocks. After the Commit
Method, you can set a new transaction type and change it again if it is required. After
the second Table.Get line, the CurrentTransactionType method call is ignored. The
transaction type remains Update.

In Example 6, the initial transaction type is UpdateNoLocks. The first two times that you
try to change to a less isolated transaction type, the method call is ignored. Finally, when
you try to change to a more isolated transaction type, the method call causes an error
message to be generated.

```
//Example 5
OnInsert
CurrentTransactionType := TransactionType::Browse;
Table.Get;
CurrentTransactionType := TransactionType::Browse;
CurrentTransactionType := TransactionType::Update;
Commit;
CurrentTransactionType := TransactionType::Browse;
CurrentTransactionType := TransactionType::Update;
Table.Get;
CurrentTransactionType := TransactionType::Browse;
OnInsert.RETURN
Commit;
```
### Example 6

```
//Example 6
CodeUnit
CurrentTransactionType := TransactionType::Snapshot;
Report 1
CurrentTransactionType := TransactionType::Browse;
Report 2
CurrentTransactionType := TransactionType::Update;

Gets the ID of the tenant that has started the current session. Use this method when
your code must be specific about which tenant database to access in a multitenant
deployment. For example, if your code imports data into a cache, you can make a cache
tenant-specific by using the tenant ID as a key. Also, if you want to write code that saves
documents, you can include the tenant ID in the file name or location, for example. In
those cases, you can use the TENANTID method in combination with the
COMPANYNAME method to identify the company and the tenant database.

# Date Data type

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Denotes a date ranging from January 1, 1753 to December 31, 9999.

The following methods are available on instances of the Date data type.

```
Method name Description
```
```
Day() Gets the day of month.
DayOfWeek() Gets the day of the week.
```
```
Month() Gets the month.
WeekNo() Gets the week number.
```
```
Year() Gets the year.
```
The displayed text format of the date is determined by your Region and Language
Format setting in Windows.

An undefined or blank date is specified by 0D. The undefined date is considered to be
before all other dates.

All normal dates have a corresponding closing date. The closing date for a given date is
defined as a period of time that follows a given normal date and precedes the next
normal date.

## Instance methods

```
ﾉ Expand table
```
## Undefined dates

## Normal dates and closing dates

## Syntax


The syntax for defining DateTime format follows the ISO standard.

```
The syntax for defining Date format is yyyymmddD, where D is a mandatory letter.
For example, 20180325D, read as the 25th of March, 2018.
```
To assign a normal date to a variable, use the following format: yyyymmddD.

SQL Server stores information about both date and time in columns of the DateTime
types. For date fields, Dynamics 365 Business Central uses only the date and uses a
constant value for the time. For a normal date, this constant value contains 00:00:00:000.
For a closing date, it contains 23:59:59:000.

The Dynamics 365 Business Central undefined date is represented by the earliest valid
date in SQL Server. The earliest valid date in SQL Server for a DateTime is 01-01-1753
00:00:00:000.

If you store a date in the database that is outside the valid range for a SQL DateTime, a
run-time error occurs.

This example shows a valid assignment of date. This example is compiled and run on a
computer with the regional format set to English (United States).

```
AL
```
The message window displays the following:

# DateFormula Data type

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Represents a date formula that has the same capabilities as an ordinary input string for
the CALCDATE Method (Date). The DateFormula data type is used to provide
multilanguage capabilities to the CALCDATE Method (Date).

When a date calculation formula is stored in a DateFormula field, it is converted to a
generic, non-language dependent format. When a date calculation formula is retrieved
from a DateFormula field, it is converted to a valid date conversion string for the
currently selected language.

To assign a value to a DateFormula data type, whether it is a field or a variable, you must
use the Evaluate Method.

The following table shows the syntax that is used to create the date formula.

```
Syntax Description
```
```
30D 30 days
2W 2 weeks
```
```
CM+10D Current month plus 10 days
CM+1M Current month plus one month
```
```
CQ+1M+20D Current quarter plus one month plus 20 days
CW+1W Current week plus one week
```
```
D15 On the 15th of each month
```
In Business Central, weeks begin on Monday and end on Sunday.

You must use the Format Method to make a comparison with a text string. If you do not
use this method, then the if statement will fail because you cannot compare a

# DateTime Data type

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Denotes a date and time ranging from January 1, 1753, 00:00:00.000 to December 31,
9999, 23:59:59.999. An undefined or blank DateTime is specified by 0DT.

The following methods are available on instances of the DateTime data type.

```
Method name Description
Date() Gets the date part.
```
```
Time() Gets the time part.
```
The displayed text format of a DateTime is determined by your Regional and Language
Options in Windows.

A DateTime is stored in the database as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). UTC is the
international time standard (formerly Greenwich Mean Time, or GMT). Zero hours UTC is
midnight at 0 degrees longitude.

The DateTime is always displayed as local time in Dynamics 365 Business Central. Local
time is determined by the time zone regional settings used by your computer. You must
always enter DateTimes as local time. When you enter a DateTime as local time, it is
converted to UTC using the current settings for the time zone and daylight savings time.

The DateTime data type does not support closing dates.

By default, DateTimes are displayed using the standard display format. When you use
the standard display format, seconds and milliseconds are not displayed until you select
the DateTime field. Furthermore, if you export your data using an XMLport or by writing
it to a file, the seconds and milliseconds are not exported unless you specify that
DateTime fields use another format and display this information. For more information

about how DateTime objects are displayed and the formats that are available, see
Formatting Values, Dates, and Time.

The only constant available when you use the DateTime data type is the undefined
DateTime, 0DT. To assign a constant value to a DateTime variable you must use the
CreateDateTime method.

If you use a date that is outside the valid date range, a run-time error occurs.

The syntax for defining DateTime format follows the ISO standard.

```
The syntax for defining Date format is yyyymmddD, where D is a mandatory letter.
For example, 20180325D, read as the 25th of March, 2018.
The syntax for defining Time format is hhmmssT, where T is the time designator. For
example, 093125H, read as 9:13:25.
```
In SQL Server, the earliest permitted DateTime is January 1, 1753, 00:00:00.000. The
latest permitted DateTime is December 31, 9999, 23:59:59.999. If you store a date in the
database that is outside the valid range for a SQL DateTime, a runtime error occurs.

# Decimal Data type

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Denotes decimal numbers ranging from -999,999,999,999,999.99 to
+999,999,999,999,999.99.

The following are examples of decimal values.

The following is not a decimal, but rather an Integer Data Type.

The Decimal data type is mapped to the Microsoft .NET Framework common language
runtime (CLR) Decimal data type, which controls and the precision and limits for
variables.

The following table shows the limits for variables of type Decimal.

```
Limit Value
Maximum format value.
```
```
This is the maximum value that can
```
```
+/- 999,999,999,999,999.99
```
## Example 1

```
546.88
3425.57
```
## Example 2

```
342
```
## Limits on Decimal Data Type Variables

```
ﾉ Expand table
```

```
Limit Value
be:
```
- Formatted into a TEXT variable by
the Format function.
- Input from the UI or XMLPorts.
- Assigned directly in source code.

```
Maximum field data type value.
```
```
This is the maximum value that a
field variable in a record can hold
while not being persisted.
```
```
+/- 999,999,999,999,999.99
```
```
Maximum persisted value.
```
```
This is the maximum value that can
be stored in the database.
```
```
Can read previous stored values but cannot store values
outside the formatting range since field variables cannot be
assigned values outside the formatting range.
```
```
Maximum calculating value.
```
```
This is the maximum value that can
be calculated by code statements
while not assigning to a field
variable, storing to the database, or
formatting to a text variable.
```
```
+/- 79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,335
```
```
Scaling factor (digits after decimal
point) for calculating values
```
```
28
```
```
For example, 7.9228162514264337593543950335
```
The maximum safe value that will work on all Business Central versions of is +/-
999,999,999,999,999.99.

It is possible to assign to a variable the maximum value that can be formatted and then
multiply that variable by a large positive number, thereby generating a greater value.
However, we do not recommend doing this. If you do, you will get errors if you attempt
to format this variable to a text variable or assign the variable to a field variable in a
record.

Specifies the string that is displayed in the dialog box. Use a backslash (\) to indicate a
new line. The string can be a label that is enabled for multilanguage functionality.

_[Optional] Default_
Type: Boolean
Specifies the default button. If you do not specify a default button, then No is used as
the default button.

_[Optional] Value1_
Type: Any

## Syntax

```
Ok := Dialog.Confirm(String: Text [, Default: Boolean] [, Value1:
Any,...])
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
```
## Parameters

## Return Value


_Ok_
Type: Boolean

The message window is automatically sized. The height of the window corresponds to
the number of lines and the width corresponds to the length of the longest line.

We recommend that you always end Confirm messages with a question mark. For more

information about best practices for end-user messages, see Progress Windows,
Message, Error, and Confirm Methods.

In the following example, the Dialog.Confirm method prompts the user for a **true** or
**false** answer.

```
AL
```
The first dialog box shows:

**Exit without saving changes to customer 1121212?**

If you select the default **true** value, then the second dialog box is shown:

**You selected true.**

# Dialog.Error(Text [, Any,...]) Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Displays an error message and ends the execution of AL code.

```
AL
```
_Message_
Type: Text
This string contains the text of the error message you want to display to the user. Use
percent signs (%) or number signs (#) to insert variable values into the string. Place the
percent or number signs where you want to substitute the variable value. The string can
be a label that is enabled for multilanguage functionality.

_[Optional] Value_
Type: Any
Any variable or expression to be inserted in String. You can insert up to 10 values. For
'#'-type fields, the value is truncated according to the total number of number-sign
characters in String. For '%'-type fields, the full length of the value is printed.

The window is automatically sized to hold the longest line of text and total number of
lines. By calling the method with an **empty** string the execution of AL code ends without
displaying a message.

## Syntax

```
Dialog.Error(Message: Text [, Value: Any,...])
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
```
## Parameters

## Remarks


Improving error handling and error messages reduces friction for the users and highly
impacts the user experience. Clear and informative error messages help users
understand what went wrong and how to correct it, which reduces frustration, and
improves user satisfaction.

For guidance on how to formulate good error messages, see Error message best
practices - what to say?.

This example shows how to use the Error method.

```
AL
```
The error window displays the following:

**Finance Account 1230 must not be blocked.**

The Error method causes execution of AL code to stop. Message Method is never

executed.

```
７ Note
```
```
Consider using the newer version of the Dialog.Error method
Dialog.Error(ErrorInfo) Method to use many of the newer features in error dialogs,
such as (hidden) detailed error messages for the person who needs to
troubleshoot, error message titles, and support for actionable errors.
```
### Guidelines for error messages

### Example

```
var
AccountNo: Integer;
Text000: Label 'Finance Account #1#### must not be blocked.';
Text001: Label 'Placeholder message.';
begin
AccountNo := 1230 ;
// The execution stops when the error statement is executed
// and all following statements will never be executed.
Error(Text000, AccountNo);
Message(Text001); // This line is not executed.
end;

# Dialog.Open(Text [, var Any,...]) Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Opens a dialog window.

```
AL
```
_Dialog_
Type: Dialog
An instance of the Dialog data type.

_String_
Type: Text
This string contains the text that you want to display in the window. Use a backslash (\)
to start a new line. Use number signs (#) to insert variable values into the string. Place
the number signs where you want to substitute the variable value. Place a number in the
part of the string where a variable value will be substituted (for example, #1####) to be
able to reference this field for updating. The number of # characters in the string
indicates the length of the field. You can update the fields using the UPDATE method
(Dialog) or by letting the user edit the values.

_[Optional] Variable1_
Type: Any
Use these optional parameters to specify variables for field1, field2, and so on in the
String.

## Syntax

```
Dialog.Open(String: Text [, var Variable1: Any,...])
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
```
## Parameters


Dialog windows that are opened by an object are closed when the object terminates.

Dialog windows are automatically sized to hold the longest line of text and the total
number of lines.

We recommend the following guidelines:

```
Enter messages as text constants.
Write messages using active voice. For example, write "Processing items" instead
of writing "Items are being processed."
Align the # field to the left with at least one space character between the text and
the variable.
```
This example shows how to use the dialog.Open method.

```
AL
```
### Remarks

```
７ Note
```
```
The use of a backslash (\) to initiate a new line is not applicable to progress
dialogs that are displayed during the Generation or Regeneration process of a
PromptDialog page. For more information, see The PromptDialog page type.
```
```
７ Note
```
```
With the Dynamics NAV Client connected to Business Central, you can use @
characters instead of # characters for the String parameter to display the value as
percentage and a progress indicator. The percentage value that is displayed is the
percentage of the variable value from 0 to 9999. This is not supported in the
Business Central Web client.
```
### Example 1

```
var
MyDialog: Dialog;
MyNext: Integer;
Text000: Label 'Counting to 4 #1:';
begin
MyNext := 0 ;
MyDialog.Open(Text000,MyNext);
repeat
```

The dialog window opens and displays this text:

**Counting to 4: 0**

Every one second, the dialog window updates with the new value of _MyNext_ until it
reaches 4, then the dialog window closes.

This example shows how to use the dialog.Open method to display a progress indicator
in the Dynamics NAV Client connected to Business Central. The progress indicator will
not display in the Business Central Web client.

```
AL
```
The dialog window opens and displays the progress indicator and percentage.

# Dictionary Data type

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Represents an unordered collection of keys and values. The Dictionary data type is
optimized for fast lookup of values.

The following methods are available on instances of the Dictionary data type.

```
Method name Description
Add(TKey, TValue) Adds the specified key and value to the dictionary.
```
```
ContainsKey(TKey) Determines whether the Dictionary contains the specified key.
Count() Gets the number of key/value pairs contained in the Dictionary.
```
```
Get(TKey, var TValue) Gets the value associated with the specified key.
Get(TKey) Gets the value associated with the specified key.
```
```
Keys() Gets a collection containing the keys in the Dictionary.
Remove(TKey) Removes the value with the specified key from the Dictionary.
```
```
Set(TKey, TValue) Sets the value associated with the specified key.
Set(TKey, TValue, var TValue) Sets the value associated with the specified key.
```
```
Values() Gets a collection containing the values in the Dictionary.
```
Each addition to the dictionary consists of a value, and its associated key. Every key in a
Dictionary must be unique. A key cannot be null, but a value can be, only when the
value type is a reference type.

A Dictionary is a reference type, so assigning an instance of a dictionary to another
variable or passing as a method parameter by value (for example without var), creates a

second variable that reads/writes the same dictionary. _It does not create a new
dictionary_.

To create a new dictionary that contains the same values as the original dictionary, you
can do the following to perform a _shallow copy_ :

```
AL
```
The Dictionary data type does not support holding instantiated records. For this
purpose, use temporary tables.

In the following example, the variable counter represents the Dictionary data type to

store a value representing the number of occurrences for each character in the
customerName. Using the Get method, you get the number of occurrences for the

character at position i. If i returns **false** , it means there is no value associated with that

character, so you add the value 1. If i returns **true** , it means the value already exists, so
you add c + 1 to the value. The Add method adds the {key:value} pair to the Dictionary.

```
AL
```
```
trigger OnRun()
var
dict1: Dictionary of [Integer, Integer];
dict2: Dictionary of [Integer, Integer];
dictionaryKey: Integer;
begin
// ...
foreach dictionaryKey in dict1.Keys() do
dict2.Add(dictionaryKey, dict1.Get(dictionaryKey));
end;
```
```
２ Warning
```
```
Previously in C/AL, one would have typically used an in-memory temporary table to
create a key-value data structure, as shown in the code below. In AL you use the
Dictionary Data Type instead.
```
```
IF KeyCacheRec.Get(‘Some Value’) THEN

# ErrorInfo.AddAction(Text, Integer, Text)

# Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 11.0.
```
Specifies an action for the error.

```
AL
```
_ErrorInfo_
Type: ErrorInfo
An instance of the ErrorInfo data type.

_Caption_
Type: Text
The text string that appears as the caption of the action in the error UI. The string can be
a label that is enabled for multilanguage functionality.

_CodeunitID_
Type: Integer
The ID of the Codeunit to run when the action is initiated from the error UI. The
codeunit should contain at least one global method to be called by the error action. The
global method must have an ErrorInfo data type parameter for accepting the ErrorInfo
object.

_MethodName_
Type: Text
The name of the method in the Codeunit, which is specified by the CodeunitID
parameter, that you want to run for the action.

## Syntax

```
ErrorInfo.AddAction(Caption: Text, CodeunitID: Integer, MethodName: Text)
```
## Parameters

## Remarks


The **AddAction** method accepts four parameters:

```
Caption , which is the text string that appears as the caption of the action in the
error UI.
CodeunitID , which is the ID of the codeunit to run when the action is initiated from
the error UI. The codeunit should contain at least one global method to be called
by the error action. The global method must have an ErrorInfo data type parameter
for accepting the ErrorInfo object.
Method Name , which is the name of the method in the codeunit specified by the
CodeunitID parameter, that you want to run for the action.
Tooltip , which is the text string that appears as the tooltip of the action in the error
UI.
```
If you call ErrorInfo.AddAction and codeunit exists with the provided _CodeunitID_ or no
method called _MethodName_ exists in that codeunit, then a runtime error occurs.

If possible, call ErrorInfo.AddAction using Codeunit::CodeunitName and not the literal
integer for the object ID of the codeunit. If there is a renumbering of the codeunit or if
the codeunit was removed, then you get a compile-time error and not a runtime error.

In the following example from the Business Central base app, you can see how an error
message can be annotated with actions that the user can do to get unblocked.

```
AL
```
### Example

```
procedure PreventModifyRecIfOpenApprovalEntryExistForCurrentUser(Variant:
Variant)
var
WorkflowWebhookMgt: Codeunit "Workflow Webhook Management";
RecRef: RecordRef;
ErrInfo: ErrorInfo;
RejectApprovalRequestLbl: Label 'Reject approval';
ShowCommentsLbl: Label 'Show comments';
RejectApprovalRequestToolTipLbl: Label 'Reject approval request';
ShowCommentsToolTipLbl: Label 'Show approval comments';
begin
RecRef.GetTable(Variant);
if HasOpenApprovalEntriesForCurrentUser(RecRef.RecordId) or
WorkflowWebhookMgt.HasPendingWorkflowWebhookEntryByRecordId(RecRef.RecordId)
then begin

# FieldRef.Active() Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Checks whether the field that is currently selected is enabled.

```
AL
```
_FieldRef_
Type: FieldRef
An instance of the FieldRef data type.

_Ok_
Type: Boolean

Each field in a record can be set as enabled or disabled in the table description. You
cannot use a disabled field because disabled fields cannot contain data.

This method is like the FieldActive Method (Record).

## Syntax

```
Ok := FieldRef.Active()
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked using property access syntax.
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks

## Example


The following example opens table 18 (Customer) as a RecordRef variable that is named
Recref. The Field Method (RecordRef) uses Recref to create a FieldRef variable that is
named MyFieldRef. MyFieldRef sets a reference to the first field (field 1) in the table. The
SetRange Method (FieldRef) sets a filter that selects record 30000. The Field Method
(RecordRef) selects the record and then loops through fields 1 through 6. For each field,
the Active method determines whether the field is enabled. If the field is enabled, a
message that states that the field is enabled is displayed. Otherwise, a message that
states that the field is not enabled is displayed.

```
AL
```
```
AL
```
```
７ Note
```
```
You can use the name of the table instead of the table number to open the table by
using the following syntax:
```
```
RecRef.Open(DATABASE::Customer)
```
```
var
Recref: RecordRef;
MyFieldRef: FieldRef;
i: Integer;
Text000: Label 'Field %1 is enabled.';
Text001: Label 'Field %1 is not enabled.';
begin
Recref.Open( 18 );
MyFieldRef := Recref.Field( 1 );
MyFieldRef.SetRange('30000');
Recref.Find('-');
for i := 1 to 5 do begin
MyFieldRef := Recref.FieldIndex(i);
if MyFieldRef.Active then
Message(Text000, i)
else begin
Message(Text001, i)
end;
end;
end;

# FieldRef.CalcField() Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Updates FlowFields in a record.

```
AL
```
_FieldRef_
Type: FieldRef
An instance of the FieldRef data type.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

FlowFields are virtual fields. The values in these fields are not saved in the table. This
means that you must use the CalcFields method to update them. For example, if you
retrieve a record using the Find Method (RecordRef) and Next Method (RecordRef)
methods, the FlowFields in those records are set to zero (0). Then, you can call
FieldRef.CalcField, to calculate the value in one of the FlowFields.

When a FlowField is a direct source expression of a control on a page or a report, the
calculation is automatically performed. You can also use the CALCFieldS method to
calculate binary large objects (BLOBs). For more information, see BLOB Data Type.

## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] FieldRef.CalcField()
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


#### Feedback

This method is similar to the CalcFields Method (Record) method.

The following example opens table 18 (Customer) as a RecordRef variable that is named
CustRecordref. The Find Method (RecordRef) selects the first record in the table and
then loops through all the records until no records could be found. For each record, the
Field Method (RecordRef) creates a FieldRef variable that is named MyFieldref for the
Balance Due field (field 66), which is a flow field. The CalcField method is called to
update the field before the customer ID and the balance due are displayed. Otherwise,
the balance due for every record will be set to 0.

# FieldRef.CalcSum() Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Calculates the total of all values of a SumIndexField in a table.

```
AL
```
_FieldRef_
Type: FieldRef
An instance of the FieldRef data type.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

This method is like the CalcSums Method (Record) method. This method operates only
on records that meet the conditions of any filters associated with the record.

If possible, the CalcSum method uses SumIndexField Technology (SIFT). SIFT is used only
if the following conditions are true:

```
The Dynamics 365 key contains the fields that are used in the filters that are
defined for the FlowField.
```
```
The SumIndexFields on the Dynamics 365 key contain the field to which the
FieldRef parameter refers.
```
## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] FieldRef.CalcSum()
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


```
The MaintainSIFTIndex Property is set to true.
```
For Dynamics 365 Business Central, CalcSum execution is decoupled from Dynamics 365
SIFT index definitions. This means that if any of the conditions for using SIFT indexes are
not true, then Dynamics 365 traverses all records in the base table to perform the
calculation instead of using SIFT. This can reduce the number of required SIFT indexes,
which can improve performance. In earlier versions of Dynamics 365, if the conditions
for using SIFT indexes were not true and the **MaintainSIFTIndex** property was enabled,
then you received an error when you called the CalcSum method. This provided a
degree of protection in earlier versions against accidentally requesting a sorting for
which no index existed. In Dynamics 365 Business Central, an index is not required to
support a certain sorting, but sorting without an index could lead to bad performance if
a search returns a large result set, which would then have to be sorted before the first
row is returned.

This example sets a RecordRef variable to refer to table 21, the **Cust. Ledger Entry** table.
Next, it creates a reference to field 18, the **Sales (LCY)** field, in the **Cust. Ledger Entry**
table and assigns the field reference to a FieldRef variable. The **Sales (LCY)** field is a
decimal field and is one of the SumIndexFields on a Dynamics 365 key in the **Cust.
Ledger Entry** table. The code displays the original Value of the FieldRef variable, then
calls the CalcSum method and displays the calculated value of the field.

```
AL
```
On a computer that has the regional format set to English (United States), the first

var
MyFieldRef: FieldRef;
MyRecRef: RecordRef;
begin
MyRecRef.Open( 21 );
MyFieldRef := MyRecRef.Field( 18 );
Message('Before CalcSum, Sales (LCY) is %1.', MyFieldRef.Value);

_Class_
Type: FieldClass

The FieldRef refers to the field that you are interested in.

The Class method returns the class as an Option. However, you cannot assign the class
to an Option variable directly. Instead, you must use the Evaluate Method. The Evaluate
method has a variable parameter to which the value is assigned and a string parameter.

## Syntax

```
Class := FieldRef.Class()
```

```
This method can be invoked using property access syntax.

## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


#### Feedback

You use the Format method to convert the result of the FieldRef.Class method to Text,
and then use the Evaluate method to convert the Text to an Option.

In this example, the return value of the Class method is converted to Text and then
converted to an Option. The value of the **OptionString** property of OptionVar is
Normal,FlowFilter,FlowField.

```

```
In this example, the return value of the Class method is converted to Text and then

The following example opens the Customer table as a RecordRef variable that is named
CustomerRecref. The Field Method (RecordRef) creates a FieldRef for the first field (No.)
and stores the reference in the MyFieldRef variable. The GetFilter method retrieves the
filters that are set on the No. field and stores the value in the Filters1 variable. The value
of any filter that is set is displayed in a message box. The SetFilter Method (FieldRef) sets
the filter that selects records from 10000 to 40000 in the No. field. The GetFilter method
retrieves and stores the filter in the Filter2 variable and displays it in a message. The
value in the Filter1 variable is blank because no filter is set. The value in Filter2 is

The following example opens table 18, the **Customer** table, a RecordRef variable that is
named CustomerRecref. The Field Method (RecordRef) creates a FieldRef for the first
field (No.). The reference to the field is stored in the MyFieldRef variable. The Active
Method (FieldRef) method determines whether the field is enabled. If the field is
enabled, then the record that is identified by the number in the CustomerNo variable is
selected. The MyFieldRef variable is updated to refer to the second field (Name). Then
the value in the second field is changed to Contoso. The Modify Method (RecordRef)
modifies the record in the table to reflect the change. MyFieldRef.Value retrieves the

new name and displays it in message box.

## Parameters


_ToFolder_
Type: Text
The default folder in which to save the file to be downloaded. The folder name is
displayed in the dialog box for downloading the file. The folder can be changed by the
user. This parameter is not supported by the web client. By default, the files are saved to
the default download location that is configured in the end-user's browser.

_ToFilter_
Type: Text
The type of file that can be downloaded to the client computer. The type is displayed in
the dialog box for downloading the file. This parameter is not supported by the web
client.

_ToFile_
Type: Text
The name to give the downloaded file. This is the default file name that is shown in the

value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

Files are saved to the default download location that is configured in the end-user's
browser.

The business logic is run on the computer that is running Dynamics 365 Business Central
service and not on the client. Files are created on the computer that is running Dynamics
365 Business Central service and not locally on the client computer.

### Return Value

### Remarks

```
７ Note
```
```
On devices that run Apple iOS, such as iPad, you can only download a file if the
Apple iOS device on which you are downloading the file has an application which
supports the file type.
```

Upload Method (File) and UploadIntoStream Method (File) are used to send a file from
the client to a Dynamics 365 Business Central service instance.

Download Method (File) and DownloadFromStream Method (File) are used to send a file
from a Dynamics 365 Business Central service instance to the client.

We recommend that you use the methods in codeunit **419 File Management** to upload
and download files.

This example shows how to use the Download method.

```

```
File Data Type

Developing Extensions

```
７ Note
```
```
Internet browsers can only handle one file per request. Therefore, with the Web
client, if this method is called in a repetitive statement (or loop) that generates
multiple files, only the last file will be sent to the browser. Alternatively, when
designing for the Web client, bundle the files in an archive file (.zip), for example, by
using the methods found in codeunit 419 File Management. For more details about
this design pattern, see Multi-File Download. The methods in codeunit 419
aren't external, therefore can't be used in extensions. Instead, when developing
extensions in AL, use the external methods of codeunit 425 Data Compression. The
approach is similar.
```
### Example

```
var
ToFile: Text;
begin
ToFile := 'ToFile.txt';
Download('FromFile.txt','Download file','C:\','Text
file(*.txt)|*.txt',ToFile);
end;

this design pattern, see Multi-File Download. The methods in codeunit 419
aren't external, therefore can't be used in extensions. Instead, when developing
extensions in AL, use the external methods of codeunit 425 Data Compression. The
approach is similar.
```
### Example - Cloud

```
procedure DownloadFromCloud()
var
Data: BigText;
ins: InStream;
outs: OutStream;
TempBLOB: codeunit "Temp Blob";
filename: Text;
begin
Data.AddText('Hello World');
TempBLOB.CreateOutStream(outs);
Data.Write(outs);
TempBLOB.CreateInStream(ins);
filename := 'helloworld.txt';
DownloadFromStream(
ins, // InStream to save
'', // Not used in cloud
'', // Not used in cloud
'', // Not used in cloud
filename); // Filename is browser download folder
end;
```
### Example - On-premises

TempFile: File;
NewStream: InsTream;
ToFileName: Variant;

**true** if the server instance has access to the file; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional
return value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

The following example uses the Exists method to determine whether the specified file
exists. If the file exists, then the WriteMode Method (File) allows the file to be open for
writing. The Open Method (File) opens the file, the Write Method (File) writes the text
“Hello World” to the file, and then the Close Method (File) method closes the file. If the
file does not exist, an error message is displayed. This example assumes that you have
created the following file C:\TestFolder\TestFile2.txt.

This method is often used with Pos Method (File) and Seek Method (File).

The following example opens a text file that is named 'C:\TestFolder\TestFile.txt' and
contains the text ‘Hello World’. The Seek Method (File) sets a pointer to position 6 in the
file. The Read Method (File) reads the file and stores the retrieved contents in the
varString variable. The LEN method retrieves the length of the file and stores it the
varLength variable. The text that is read starts from the position of the pointer, so the
text ‘World’ and the length of 12 are displayed in the message box. The length of the file
is not affected by the Seek Method (File). This example assumes that you have created
the text file that is named C:\TestFolder\TestFile.txt and contains the text ‘Hello World’.
This example requires that you create the following global variables.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

If you call Open on a file variable that refers to an open file, then the method does not
automatically close the existing file and open the new file. You must explicitly call the
Close Method (File) to close the existing file. If you call Open on a file that is already
open, then a run-time error occurs.

example, you must create the simple.xml file at C:\temp and create the following
variable.

This method is often used with Len Method (File) and Seek Method (File).

The following example opens a text file that is named C:\TestFolder\TestFile.txt. The
WriteMode Method (File) enables the file to be open in write mode. The POS method
retrieves the position of the file pointer and stores it in the Position variable. When the
file is open, the position of the pointer is 0 because a pointer is not set. The Seek
Method (File) method sets a file pointer at position 5. After the Seek Method (File) is
executed, the POS method returns 5 as the file pointer position. This example assumes
that you have created a text file named C:\TestFolder\TestFile.txt.

```
## Parameters

## Return Value


To read from a file that is larger than 1024 bytes, use streams instead of the **File.Read**
method.

MS-DOS encoding, which is also referred to as OEM encoding, is an older format than
UTF-8 and UTF-16, but it is still widely supported. MS-DOS encoding was the only
format that was supported by earlier versions of Dynamics 365.

MS-DOS encoding requires a different character set for each language. MS-DOS text is
encoded to the internal Unicode data type by using the system locale language of the
computer that is running Dynamics 365 Business Central service. If you read a file that
uses MS-DOS encoding, then you must set the system locale language of the computer
that is running Dynamics 365 Business Central service to match the language of the data
in the file that is being read. For example, if the file contains text in Danish, then you
must set the system locale language of the computer that is running Dynamics 365
Business Central service to Danish before you call the **Read** method (File) or Write
Method (File).

We recommend that you use the File data type for files that were created in earlier
versions of Dynamics 365.

To read or write files in Unicode or in other formats, we recommend that you use .NET
Framework interoperability and use the System.IO Namespace.

The following example opens a text file that is named C:\TestFolder\TestFile.txt. The
READ method read the contents of the file and stores it in the String variable. The
method returns the size of the text that was read, stores it in the varSize variable, and
displays it in a message box. This example assumes that you have created a text file
named C:\TestFolder\TestFile.txt that contains less than 500 bytes.

```
AL
```
### Remarks

### Example

```
var
Testfile: File;
String: Text[ 500 ];
varSize: Integer;
begin
TestFile.Open('C:\TestFolder\TestFile.txt');
varSize := TestFile.Read(String);
Message('The text "%1" is %2 bytes.', String, varSize);

_[Optional] Textmode_

This method should be used before File.Open is used to open the file. If you use this
method on a file that is already open, then an error occurs.

The following example sets the TextMode to **true** when the file is open for writing. This
means the file contents will be written to a text file that is named
'C:\TestFolder\TestFile.txt' by using ASCII characters. The WriteMode Method (File) and
the Open Method (File) open the file for writing and the text ‘Hello World’ is written. The
Close Method (File) closes the file after the file is written to. This example assumes that
you have created a text file that is named C:\TestFolder\TestFile.txt.

# File.Write(BigInteger) Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Writes to an MS-DOS encoded file or binary file.

```
AL
```
_File_
Type: File
An instance of the File data type.

_Value_
Type: BigInteger
The data that you want to write to the file.

You must call the TextMode Method (File) before you call the Write method.

If TextMode Method (File) is set to **true** and _Value_ is an integer, then the integer is
written as text, followed by a new line character.

```
７ Note
```
```
This method is supported only in Business Central on-premises.
```
## Syntax

```
File.Write(Value: BigInteger)
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
```
## Parameters

## Remarks


If _Value_ is a record, each field is separated by a tab character.

If TextMode Method (File) is **false** and _Value_ is an integer, an integer is written that is
four bytes long.

MS-DOS encoding requires a different character set for each language. MS-DOS text is
encoded to the internal Unicode data type by using the system locale language of the
computer that is running Dynamics 365 Business Central service. If you write to a file
that uses MS-DOS encoding, then you must set the system locale language of the
computer that is running Dynamics 365 Business Central service to match the language
of the data that you want to write to the file.

We recommend that you use the File data type for files that were created in earlier
versions of Dynamics 365.

To read or write files in Unicode or in other formats, we recommend that you use .NET
Framework interoperability and use the System.IO Namespace.

The following example determines whether the specified file exists. If it exists, the
WriteMode Method (File) allows the file to be open for writing. The Open Method (File)
opens the file, the Write Method (File) writes the text “Hello World” to the file and then
the Close Method (File) closes the file. If the file does not exist, then an error message is
displayed. This example assumes that you have created the following file:
C:\TestFolder\TestFile.txt.

```
AL
```
### Example

```
var
FileName: Text;
TestFile: File;
begin
FileName := 'C:\TestFolder\TestFile.txt';
if Exists(FileName) then begin
TestFile.WriteMode(true);
TestFile.Open(FileName);
TestFile.Write('Hello World');
TestFile.Close;
end else
Message('%1 does not exit.', FileName);
end;

## Parameters

## Remarks


If _Value_ is a record, each field is separated by a tab character.

If TextMode Method (File) is **false** and _Value_ is an integer, an integer is written that is
four bytes long.

MS-DOS encoding requires a different character set for each language. MS-DOS text is
encoded to the internal Unicode data type by using the system locale language of the
computer that is running Dynamics 365 Business Central service. If you write to a file
that uses MS-DOS encoding, then you must set the system locale language of the
computer that is running Dynamics 365 Business Central service to match the language
of the data that you want to write to the file.

We recommend that you use the File data type for files that were created in earlier
versions of Dynamics 365.

To read or write files in Unicode or in other formats, we recommend that you use .NET
Framework interoperability and use the System.IO Namespace.

The following example determines whether the specified file exists. If it exists, the
WriteMode Method (File) allows the file to be open for writing. The Open Method (File)
opens the file, the Write Method (File) writes the text “Hello World” to the file and then
the Close Method (File) closes the file. If the file does not exist, then an error message is
displayed. This example assumes that you have created the following file:
C:\TestFolder\TestFile.txt.

```
AL
```
### Example

```
var
FileName: Text;
TestFile: File;
DteForm: DateFormula;
begin
FileName := 'C:\TestFolder\TestFile.txt';
if Exists(FileName) then begin
TestFile.WriteMode(True);
TestFile.Open(FileName);
TestFile.Write(DteForm);
TestFile.Close;
end else
Message('%1 does not exit.', FileName);
end;

## Return Value


If you omit this optional return value and the operation does not execute successfully, a
runtime error will occur.

If the filter page implementation will call a SetView Method, then the SetView Method
must be called before the AddField method call, otherwise the filter that is specified by
the _Filter_ parameter will be cleared by SetView Method.

The filter that is specified by the _Filter_ parameter will overwrite any previously defined
filters for the field which were set by AddView method or read from the record or
recordRef instance that defined the filter control.

The following example initializes a filter page object that includes a filter control for the
**Date** system table. The filter control has the caption of **Date record**. The example adds
two fields of the **Date** record variable which will be available in the filter control on the

# FilterPageBuilder.AddFieldNo(Text,

# Integer [, Text]) Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Adds a table field to the filter control for a table on the filter page.

```
AL
```
_FilterPageBuilder_
Type: FilterPageBuilder
An instance of the FilterPageBuilder data type.

_Name_
Type: Text
The name that is assigned to the table in the filter control. This value must match the
value of the Name parameter that was specified by AddTable, AddRecord, or
AddRecordRef method that adds the table to the filter control.

_FieldNo_
Type: Integer
The number that is assigned to the field in the table as specified by the Field No.
Property.

_[Optional] Filter_
Type: Text
A default filter on the field that is specified by the Field parameter.

## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] FilterPageBuilder.AddFieldNo(Name: Text, FieldNo: Integer [,
Filter: Text])
```
## Parameters

## Return Value


_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the field was added to the field list for the specified filter control; otherwise **false**.
If you omit this optional return value and the operation does not execute successfully, a
runtime error will occur.

If the filter page implementation will call a SetView Method, then the SetView Method
must be called before the AddFieldNo method call, otherwise the default filter that is
specified by the _Filter_ parameter for field, if any, will be cleared by SetView Method.

The filter that is specified by the _Filter_ parameter will overwrite any previously defined
filters for the field which were set by AddView method or read from the record or
recordRef instance that defined the filter control.

The following example initializes a filter page object that includes a filter control for the
**Date** system table. The filter control has the caption of **Date record**. The example adds
two fields of the **Date** record variable which will be available in the filter control on the
filter page: **Period End** and **Period Start**. A default filter is set on the **Period End** field.

```

# Guid Data type

Article•09/18/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Represents a 16 byte binary data type. This data type is used for the global identification
of objects, programs, records, and so on. The important property of a GUID is that each
value is globally unique. The value is generated by an algorithm, developed by
Microsoft, which assures this uniqueness.

The GUID is a 16-byte binary data type that can be logically grouped into the following
subgroups:

4byte-2byte-2byte-2byte-6byte.

The standard textual representation is {aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb}.

The virtual table OLE Control (2000000042) does not use the GUID data type. It uses a
textual representation of the GUID in a text field instead. It is easier to make operations
and references to this text field using the GUID data type than it is using the textual
representation. The GUID data type is compatible with the existing textual
representation.

The GUID data type is useful when you want to uniquely identify some data, so that it
can be exchanged with external applications. For example, if you want to transfer an
item catalog to an external application, you add a GUID field to the record in the table
and use this as the primary reference when you communicate with the external
application.

You can assign and compare the Text data type and the GUID data type. Assigning a Text
to a GUID can be done as follows:

```
AL
```
The supported formats of MyText are:

```
'aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb' '{bbbbbbbb-1111-2222-3333-cccccccccccc}'
```
## Compatibility

```
MyTableRec.MyGuid := MyTableRec.MyText;
```

The following AL methods can be used with the GUID data type:

```
AL
```
This method creates a new unique GUID value. The value can then be assigned to a field
of the GUID data type or of the Text data type.

```
AL
```
This method is a convenient way to check if a value has already been assigned to a
GUID. A NULL GUID (consisting only of zeroes) is valid, but should never be used for
reference purposes.

A NULL GUID is valid but is not useful in a table. Therefore, the **AutoSplitKey** property is
implemented for the GUID data type when it is used in a page. When GUID is selected
as a primary key, **AutoSplitKey** is enabled for the page, and the GUID value remains
NULL. When you create a new record, a valid GUID is created and assigned
automatically.

The CreateGUID method and IsNullGUID method methods are available in the AL
Symbol Menu under SYSTEM, Variables.

CreateGUID takes no arguments and returns a valid 16-byte GUID value. If the result is
assigned to a TEXT variable or field, the value is converted to a string and follows the
syntax explained earlier. The algorithm that generates the new GUID value uses
Microsoft's CoCreateGuid method.

IsNullGUID takes a GUID value as a required argument and returns True/False
depending on whether the GUID value is NULL. This method does not accept a Text
value as an argument.

**AutoSplitKey** is a property, not a method and can be applied to pages. If you have
defined a GUID field as part of the primary key, the **AutoSplitKey** property automatically
generates a new valid GUID value. When a new record is created and the GUID field is
left as NULL, the **AutoSplitKey** property ensures that a valid GUID value is automatically
inserted into the field. If you then enter a NULL GUID into this record, for example, by

### Methods and properties

```
Guid := CreateGUID();
```
```
Ok := IsNullGUID(Guid);
```

#### Feedback

using the Clear method, this new NULL GUID value is not automatically replaced by the
**AutoSplitKey** property. The **AutoSplitKey** property only applies to new records.

The GUID value can also be represented as text. You can use the standard AL methods
Format and Evaluate to convert from GUID values to Text values. If you do not use the
correct format when you edit a GUID value in its textual format, the following error
message is displayed:

**Invalid Format of GUID string. The correct format of the GUID string is {CDEF7890-
ABCD-1234-ABCD-1234567890AB} where 0-9, A-F symbolizes hexadecimal digits.**

### Remarks

### Ways that HttpClient calls can fail

```
） Important
```

Outgoing web service request telemetry gathers data about outgoing web service
requests sent using the AL HTTPClient data type. This data gives you insight into the
execution time and failures that happen in external services that your environment and
extensions depend on. You can also use the data to alert on environments or apps for
performance issues caused by external services, and be more proactive in preventing
issues from occurring.

For more information, see Outgoing Web Service Request Telemetry.

When calling external web services using the HttpClient module in AL, make sure that
you handle the HTTP status code returned by the service in case of errors. For more
information, see HttpHttpResponseMessage.HttpStatusCode() Method.

If you've enabled telemetry for your environment or app, you can use this KQL query to
analyze errors in calls to external services.

```
Kusto
```
```
The call might fail in the Business Central platform before actually reaching the
external web service. It's therefore important that you check for this in your AL
code. Common error examples are if you have added duplicate request or content
HTTP headers, if there are networking/firewall issues, if the URI cannot be resolved
with DNS, or if the app/extension has not been configured to allow HttpClient
requests in the Extension Settings.
```
```
） Important
```
```
Outbound HTTP calls from apps/extensions are blocked by default and must be
approved for each extension, otherwise instead of an external call, the system will
display the following error message: The request was blocked by the runtime to
prevent accidental use of production services.
```
```
To enable outbound HTTP calls, go to the Extension Management page in Business
Central, and choose Configure. Then, on the Extension Settings page, make sure
that Allow HttpClient Requests is selected. This setting must be enabled for each
app/extension, including library apps.
```
### Telemetry

###### Troubleshoot errors


When you try to access content on a server by using the HTTP protocol, it returns a
numeric code that indicates the result of the request and semantics of the response,
including whether the request was successful.

The first digit of the status code defines the class of response. The last two digits don't
have any categorization role. There are five values for the first digit:

1xx (Informational): Provisional response - the request was received, continuing process.

2xx (Successful): The server successfully received and accepted the request.

3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request.

4xx (Client Error): The request contains an error and can't be fulfilled.

5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill the request.

For more information, see HTTP Semantics

When you call a web service endpoint, either a Business Central API or from AL using
Httpclient datatype, you get an HTTP status code as part of the response. All HTTP
status codes that start with 4 (sometimes also written 4xx) are classified as client errors
and it is your responsibility to react on these errors and fix them in your code.

In the following table, we list some common 4xx HTTP status codes and suggestions to
how to fix them:

```
traces
| where customDimensions has 'RT0019'
| extend httpStatusCode = toint( case(
isnotempty(customDimensions.httpStatusCode),
customDimensions.httpStatusCode, customDimensions.httpReturnCode ) )
| where httpStatusCode > 299
| summarize count() // how many calls fail
by httpStatusCode
, endpoint = tostring( customDimensions.endpoint ) // which endpoint

status
code**

```
Short name Description Suggested solution(s)
```
400 Bad Request This status code
indicates that the
server can't or won't
process the request
due to an error on the
client side. For
example, it could be a
malformed request
syntax, header too
long, or something
else.

```
The client code that calls the endpoint needs
to fix things on their end.
```
```
For an incoming call of category OData/API,
consider using telemetry to find the error.
You can also set up a debugger and debug
the endpoint code.
```
```
For an outgoing call, you need to
review/debug the AL code that sends the
request.
```
401 Access denied The request failed
because it lacks valid
authentication
credentials for the
target resource.

```
For an incoming call, this is an authorization
issue on the Business Central end of this,
either in the OnOpenCompany trigger or a
permission issue.
```
```
For an outgoing call, you need to examine
the AL code that sets up certificates or sets
authorization header(s).
```
402 Payment
Required

```
Indicates that the caller
must make a payment
to access the
requested resource.
Typically used in
situations where the
server requires
payment before
granting access to the
content or service.
```
```
This status code isn't
returned by the
Business Central server
for incoming calls.
```
```
For an outgoing call, you need to examine
the AL code that calls the service and setup
error handling to handle this situation.
```
403 Forbidden This status code is
returned when there's
some kind of access
restriction policy
implemented for the
requested resource.

```
For an outgoing call, you need to examine
the AL code that sets up certificates (see
Httpclient.AddCertificate or sets authorization
header(s). Or maybe your app shouldn't call
the specified endpoint at all.
```
404 Not found The resource you're
calling doesn't exist

```
For an incoming call of category OData/API,
this endpoint isn't available in metadata. If

(anymore?) the endpoint used to work, the issue might
be due to uninstalling or updating an
app/extension. For UI pages exposed as
OData, check if the page was disabled by an
administrator. Note: We recommend that you
move to APIs.
```
```
For an outgoing call, you need to examine
the URI specified in the AL code calling the
endpoint and compare it with the endpoints
available on the server you call.
```
405 Method not
allowed

```
The HTTP verb used in
the request isn't
allowed for the specific
URI that an HTTP client
requested.
```
```
For an incoming call, you need to examine
the HTTP method and compare that with
what the endpoint supports. One example
could be a client calling an API query (which
is read-only) using HTTP POST.
For on-premises environments where SOAP,
OData, or APIs have been turned off, any call
to such an endpoint will also return 405 (so
check your server configurations if you see
those).
```
```
For an outgoing call, you need to examine
the AL code that calls out and compare the
Httpclient method used with what the
external service offers.
```
408 Request timed
out

```
This status code is
returned when the
server didn't receive a
complete request
message within the
time that it was
prepared to wait.
```
```
For an incoming call, this is returned by the
Business Central server when the request fails
to complete within the limits setup in the
server configuration. For online
environments, the limits are documented
here: Operational Limits for Business Central
Online. For on-premises environments, you
might be able to adjust the server limits to
allow more time for requests to complete. For
on-premises environments, you need to
change the AL code for the endpoint or call
break up the request into multiple requests
to make them fit within the time limits.
```
```
For an outgoing call, you need to investigate
the similar limits setup for the external
service. Then either change your AL code or
```

```
Short name Description Suggested solution(s)

```
break up the request into multiple requests
to make them fit within the time limits.
```
409 Conflict Indicates that the
request couldn't be
processed because of
conflict in the current
state of the resource,
such as an edit conflict
between multiple
simultaneous updates.

```
For an incoming call, this happens when
another user has already changed the
record(s) that the request is trying to modify.
```
```
For an outgoing call, you need to look into
the documentation for the service you're
calling.
```
410 Gone Indicates that the
resource requested
was previously in use
but is no longer
available and won't be
available again.

```
Check you client code/configuration and stop
calling this endpoint.
```
412 Precondition
Failed

```
The server doesn't
meet one of the
preconditions that the
requester put on the
request header fields.
```
```
You need to examine the code that calls the
endpoint and check if the settings of request
or content HTTP headers match what the
service expects.
```
```
For an incoming call, check if you have
supplied the required headers as specified in
the API documentation, see API (v2.0) for
Business Central for details.
```
```
For an outgoing call, a common error is to
forget to set the Content-Type header (which
by default is set to 'text/plain; charset=utf-8'.
For more information about content headers,
see HttpContent Data Type.)
```
413 Payload Too
Large /
Request Entity
Too Large

```
The request is larger
than the server is
willing or able to
process.
```
```
You need to examine the code that calls the
endpoint and adjust the size of the data you
send.
```
```
For OData/API calls, the limit is called Max
body size and its current value for BC online
is documented here: OData request limits.

If you call an external web service using the HttpClient module in AL, be aware that the
Business Central Server blocks the execution of AL code for the session until the call
completes. For interactive sessions, this behavior means that the user sees a spinning
wheel during the call.

If you have enabled telemetry for your environment or app, you can use this KQL query
to analyze how much time users are delayed in the UI by calls to external services.

# HttpClient.AddCertificate(Text [, Text])

# Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Adds a certificate to the HttpClient class.

```
AL
```
_HttpClient_
Type: HttpClient
An instance of the HttpClient data type.

_Certificate_
Type: Text
The Base64 encoded certificate.

_[Optional] Password_
Type: Text
The certificate password.

The following example shows how to add a certificate to the HttpClient data type.

```
AL
```
## Syntax

```
HttpClient.AddCertificate(Certificate: Text [, Password: Text])
```
## Parameters

## Example

```
// This code shows how to use certificates with HttpClient
procedure AddCertificateToHttpClient(var HttpClient: HttpClient;
CertificateCode: Text[ 6 ])
var
IsolatedCertificate: Record "Isolated Certificate";
CertificateManagement: Codeunit "Certificate Management";
```

The certificate must be in base 64 format.

With the **AddCertificate** method you set the certificates that you want to be associated
to the request of the http client connection. These have the only purpose of
authenticating the client.

The system caches SSL sessions as they are created and attempts to reuse a cached
session for a new request, if possible. When attempting to reuse an SSL session, it uses
the first certificate that was added or tries to reuse an anonymous session if no
certificates have been specified.

```
begin
if not IsolatedCertificate.Get(CertificateCode) then
exit;
HttpClient.AddCertificate(
CertificateManagement.GetCertAsBase64String(IsolatedCertificate),
CertificateManagement.GetPassword(IsolatedCertificate));
end;
```
### Remarks

```
） Important
```
```
The certificate must be use one of the supported cipher suites; otherwise, outgoing
web service calls will fail with a security exception. For more information, see
Supported cipher suites.
```
```
） Important
```
```
In Business Central versions 22 (2023 release wave 1) and later, certificates must
include the following information:
```
```
If KeyUsage is defined, specify DigitalSignature.
If ExtendedKeyUsage is defined, specify ClientAuthentication.
```
```
This is due to different behavior between .NET Core and .NET Framework.
```
```
When making an outbound http call to an external endpoint, if you receive a 403
response (external endpoint required a certificate), and your code does have a
HttpClient.AddCertificate, check the version of the Business Central platform and
the requirements for KeyUsage and ExtendedKeyUsage.

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Sends a DELETE request to delete the resource identified by the request URL.

```
AL
```
_HttpClient_
Type: HttpClient
An instance of the HttpClient data type.

_Path_
Type: Text
The path the request is sent to.

_Response_
Type: HttpResponseMessage
The response received from the remote endpoint.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
Accessing the HttpContent property of HttpResponseMessage in a case when the
request fails will result in an error. If you omit this optional return value and the
operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] HttpClient.Delete(Path: Text, var Response: HttpResponseMessage)
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Ways that HttpClient.Delete calls can fail


The method HttpClient.Delete can fail and return false in the following ways:

```
The requestUri is not an absolute URI.
The request failed due to an underlying issue such as network connectivity, DNS
failure, server certificate validation or timeout.
The request failed due to timeout.
```
A DELETE request deletes an existing resource. A DELETE request is idempotent but not
safe, meaning multiple DELETE requests to the same resources yield the same result, but
the request affects the state of the resource. To make an HTTP DELETE request, given an
HttpClient and a URI, use the HttpClient.Delete method:

```
AL
```
```

```
Outbound HTTP calls from apps/extensions are blocked by default and must be
approved for each extension, otherwise instead of an external call, the system will

```
To enable outbound HTTP calls, go to the Extension Management page in Business
Central, and choose Configure. Then, on the Extension Settings page, make sure
that Allow HttpClient Requests is selected. This setting must be enabled for each
app/extension, including library apps.

request fails will result in an error. If you omit this optional return value and the
operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

The method HttpClient.Post can fail and return false in the following ways:

```
The requestUri is not an absolute URI.
The request failed due to an underlying issue such as network connectivity, DNS
failure, server certificate validation or timeout.
The request failed due to timeout.
```
A POST request sends data to the server for processing. The Content-Type header of the
request signifies what MIME type the body is sending. To make an HTTP POST request,
given an HttpClient and a Uri, use the HttpClient.Post method:

```
AL
```
### Ways that HttpClient.Post calls can fail

```
） Important
```
```
Outbound HTTP calls from apps/extensions are blocked by default and must be
approved for each extension, otherwise instead of an external call, the system will
display the following error message: The request was blocked by the runtime to
prevent accidental use of production services.
```
```
To enable outbound HTTP calls, go to the Extension Management page in Business
Central, and choose Configure. Then, on the Extension Settings page, make sure
that Allow HttpClient Requests is selected. This setting must be enabled for each
app/extension, including library apps.
```
### Example (HTTP POST)

```
local procedure PostRequest(json: Text;) ResponseText: Text
var
Client: HttpClient;
Content: HttpContent
ContentHeaders: HttpHeaders;
IsSuccessful: Boolean;
Response: HttpResponseMessage;
ResponseText: Text;
begin
Content.GetHeaders(ContentHeaders);
```
```
if ContentHeaders.Contains('Content-Type') then
```

The preceding code:

```
Prepares an HttpContent instance with the JSON body of the request (MIME type
of "application/json" and using the character encoding UTF8).
Makes a POST request to "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos".
Ensures that the response is successful.
Reads the response body as a string.
```
```
headers.Remove('Content-Type');
ContentHeaders.Add('Content-Type', 'application/json');
```
```
if ContentHeaders.Contains('Content-Encoding') then
headers.Remove('Content-Encoding');
ContentHeaders.Add('Content-Encoding', 'UTF8');
```
```
// assume that the json parameter contains the following data
//
// {
// userId = 77,
// id = 1,
// title = "write code sample",
// completed = false
// }
Content.WriteFrom(json);
IsSuccessful :=
Client.Post('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos', Content,
Response);
if not IsSuccessful then begin
// handle the error
end;
if not Response.IsSuccessStatusCode() then begin
HttpStatusCode := response.HttpStatusCode();
// handle the error (depending on the HTTP status code)
end;
Response.Content().ReadAs(ResponseText);
```
```
// Expected output:
// POST https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos HTTP/1.1
// {
// "userId": 77,
// "id": 201,
// "title": "write code sample",
// "completed": false
// }
end;
```

The Content-Type _multipart/form-data_ allows you to post multiple types of data in the
same HTTP request and is commonly used for streaming data to an endpoint.

To use multipart/form-data with Httpclient, you need to do the following:

1. Create a _content payload_ , including defining the boundary between data elements
2. Add the file content and file name to the content payload
3. Set up the HTTP content header multipart/form-data

After these steps, your AL code should follows usual practices for Httpclient POST
requests.

The methods for adding file content to the content payload differs depending if the file
is a text file such as JSON or XML, or if it's a binary file. So we provided two different
code examples below, one for each scenario:

```
AL
```
### Example (How to upload a file using

### multipart/form-data)

###### Example (How to upload a text file using multipart/form-

###### data)

```
procedure UploadJson(json: Text; Url: Text)
var
Client: HttpClient;
Content: HttpContent;
Headers: HttpHeaders;
Response: HttpResponseMessage;
MultiPartBody: TextBuilder;
Boundary: Text;
ResponseMessage: Text;
begin
Boundary := CreateGuid();
MultiPartBody.AppendLine('--' + Format(Boundary));
MultiPartBody.AppendLine('Content-Disposition: form-data; name="<add
your formname here>"');
MultiPartBody.AppendLine();
MultiPartBody.AppendLine('--' + Format(Boundary));
MultiPartBody.AppendLine('Content-Disposition: form-data;
name="file"; filename="<add filename here>"');
MultiPartBody.AppendLine('Content-Type: application/octet-stream');
MultiPartBody.AppendLine();
MultiPartBody.AppendLine(json);
MultiPartBody.AppendLine('--' + Format(Boundary) + '--');
```

The main reason for the code example being different when dealing with binary data is
that we need to preserve the encoding of the data. A conversion to text might change
the encoding.

```
AL
```
```
Content.WriteFrom(MultiPartBody.ToText());
Content.GetHeaders(Headers);
if Headers.Contains('Content-Type') then
Headers.Remove('Content-Type');
Headers.Add('Content-Type', 'multipart/form-data; boundary="' +
Format(Boundary) + '"');
```
```
IsSuccessful := Client.Post(Url, Content, Response);
if not IsSuccessful then begin
// handle the error
end;
if not Response.IsSuccessStatusCode() then begin
HttpStatusCode := response.HttpStatusCode();
// handle the error (depending on the HTTP status code)
end;
```
```
end;
```
###### Example (How to upload a binary file using

###### multipart/form-data)

```
procedure UploadBinaryFile(ContentToBeUploaded: InStream; Url: Text)
var
Client: HttpClient;
Content: HttpContent;
Headers: HttpHeaders;
Response: HttpResponseMessage;
MultiPartBody: TextBuilder;
MultiPartBodyOutStream: OutStream;
MultiPartBodyInStream: InStream;
TempBlob: Record TempBlob temporary;
Boundary: Text;
ResponseMessage: Text;
begin
TempBlob.Blob.CreateOutStream(MultiPartBodyOutStream);
Boundary := CreateGuid();
MultiPartBody.AppendLine('--' + Format(Boundary));
MultiPartBody.AppendLine('Content-Disposition: form-data; name="<add
your formname here>"');
MultiPartBody.AppendLine();
MultiPartBody.AppendLine('--' + Format(Boundary));
```

Some endpoints have restrictions on the size of files that can be uploaded and hence
you might need to split and upload the file in chunks. The system application SharePoint
module has an implementation for how to achieve this. For more information, see Share
Point module.

```
MultiPartBody.AppendLine('Content-Disposition: form-data;
name="file"; filename="<add filename here>"');
//add file Content-Type eg. image/jpeg, image/png. If not known, use
application/octet-stream.
MultiPartBody.AppendLine('Content-Type: <add file Content-Type
here>');
MultiPartBody.AppendLine();
MultiPartBodyOutStream.WriteText(MultiPartBody.ToText());
CopyStream(MultiPartBodyOutStream, ContentToBeUploaded);
```
```
MultiPartBody.Clear();
MultiPartBody.AppendLine();
MultiPartBody.AppendLine('--' + Format(Boundary) + '--');
MultiPartBodyOutStream.WriteText(MultiPartBody.ToText());
```
```
TempBlob.Blob.CreateInStream(MultiPartBodyInStream);
Content.WriteFrom(MultiPartBodyInStream);
```
```
Content.GetHeaders(Headers);
if Headers.Contains('Content-Type') then
Headers.Remove('Content-Type');
Headers.Add('Content-Type', 'multipart/form-data; boundary="' +
Format(Boundary) + '"');
IsSuccessful := Client.Post(Url, Content, Response);
```
```
if not IsSuccessful then begin
// handle the error
end;
```
```
if not Response.IsSuccessStatusCode() then begin
HttpStatusCode := response.HttpStatusCode();
// handle the error (depending on the HTTP status code)
end;
end;
```
###### Example (How to upload large files using multipart/form-

###### data)

### Content headers


By default, the content headers contain a header for 'Content-Type', namely 'text/plain;
charset=utf-8'. This is important to adjust if the endpoint you're calling expects a
different content type, for example, multipart/form-data or application/json.

The following AL code examples illustrate ways to change the content header.

```
AL
```
```
AL
```
When calling an endpoint, you get a response back from the service you called. The
response is saved in the data type HttpResponseMessage, where you can parse it to use
the information in your app. The service call itself might not succeed, so make sure that
you check the HTTP status code in your AL code. In the case of setting the wrong

```
local procedure SendRequest(HttpMethod: Text[ 6 ]) ResponseText: Text
var
Client: HttpClient;
Content: HttpContent;
ContentHeaders: HttpHeaders;
begin
Content.GetHeaders(ContentHeaders);
// If you want to set all the headers yourself, do it this way
ContentHeaders.Clear();
ContentHeaders.Add('Content-Type', 'multipart/form-
data;boundary=boundary');
// from here on, the method must deal with calling out to the
external service.
end;
```
```
local procedure SendRequest(HttpMethod: Text[ 6 ]) ResponseText: Text
var
Client: HttpClient;
Content: HttpContent;
ContentHeaders: HttpHeaders;
begin
Content.GetHeaders(ContentHeaders);
// In this example, you just change the headers you need
if ContentHeaders.Contains('Content-Type') then
ContentHeaders.Remove('Content-Type');
ContentHeaders.Add('Content-Type', 'multipart/form-
data;boundary=boundary');
```
```
// from here on, the method must deal with calling out to the
external service.
end;
```

content type header, you'll typically receive the _415 Unsupported Media Type_ return
code. This return code can also be due to the request's _Content-Encoding_ header, or if
the data you send doesn't match what the endpoint expects.

The method HttpClient.Send can fail and return false in the following ways:

```
The requestUri is not an absolute URI.
The chosen HTTP method is not supported.
The request failed due to an underlying issue such as network connectivity, DNS
failure, server certificate validation or timeout.
The request failed due to timeout.

As an example of how to use the HttpClient.Send, we illustrate how to do a HTTP PATCH
request. Examples of the other supported HTTP methods (DELETE, GET, POST, or PUT),
see the respective articles for their methods (HttpClient.Delete, HttpClient.Get,
HttpClient.Post, or HttpClient.Put).

The PATCH request is a partial update to an existing resource. It doesn't create a new
resource, and it's not intended to replace an existing resource. Instead, it updates a
resource only partially. To make an HTTP PATCH request, given an HttpClient and a URI,
use the HttpClient.Send method:

configured for Business Central Server instance. If you set the duration to a value that is
greater than the value of the **NavHttpClientMaxTimeout** parameter, a
'NavNclHttpClientTimeoutTooLargeException' error is thrown. The default value of the
**NavHttpClientMaxTimeout** parameter is 00:05:00. To change the

# HttpContent Data type

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Represents an HTTP entity body and content headers.

The following methods are available on instances of the HttpContent data type.

```
Method name Description
```
```
Clear() Sets the HttpContent object to a default value. The content contains
an empty string and empty headers.
```
```
GetHeaders(var
HttpHeaders)
```
```
Gets the HTTP content headers as defined in RFC 2616.
```
```
IsSecretContent() Returns if the content is secret. If it is secret it can be read only as a
SecretText.
ReadAs(var SecretText) Reads the content into the provided secure text.
```
```
ReadAs(var Text) Reads the content into the provided text.
ReadAs(var InStream) Reads the content into the provided text.
```
```
WriteFrom(Text) Sets HttpContent content to the provided text or stream.
WriteFrom(SecretText) Sets HttpContent content to the provided SecretText.
```
```
WriteFrom(InStream) Sets HttpContent content to the provided text or stream.
```
An instance of HttpContent encapsulates the body and the associated headers of an
HTTP request that will be sent to a remote endpoint or that is being received from a
remote endpoint. The HttpContent data type is a value type. This means that when
assigning an instance of HttpContent to a variable, a copy will be created.

## Instance methods

```
ﾉ Expand table
```
## Content headers


By default, the content headers contain a header for 'Content-Type', namely 'text/plain;
charset=utf-8'. This is important to adjust if the endpoint you're calling expects a
different content type, for example, multipart/form-data or application/json.

The following AL code examples illustrate ways to change the content header.

```
AL
```
```
AL
```
When calling an endpoint, you get a response back from the service you called. The
response is saved in the data type HttpResponseMessage, where you can parse it to use
the information in your app. The service call itself might not succeed, so make sure that
you check the HTTP status code in your AL code. In the case of setting the wrong

```
local procedure SendRequest(HttpMethod: Text[ 6 ]) ResponseText: Text
var
Client: HttpClient;
Content: HttpContent;
ContentHeaders: HttpHeaders;
begin
Content.GetHeaders(ContentHeaders);
// If you want to set all the headers yourself, do it this way
ContentHeaders.Clear();
ContentHeaders.Add('Content-Type', 'multipart/form-
data;boundary=boundary');
// from here on, the method must deal with calling out to the
external service.
end;
```
```
local procedure SendRequest(HttpMethod: Text[ 6 ]) ResponseText: Text
var
Client: HttpClient;
Content: HttpContent;
ContentHeaders: HttpHeaders;
begin
Content.GetHeaders(ContentHeaders);
// In this example, you just change the headers you need
if ContentHeaders.Contains('Content-Type') then
ContentHeaders.Remove('Content-Type');
ContentHeaders.Add('Content-Type', 'multipart/form-
data;boundary=boundary');
```
```
// from here on, the method must deal with calling out to the
external service.
end;
```

content type header, you'll typically receive the _415 Unsupported Media Type_ return
code. This return code can also be due to the request's _Content-Encoding_ header, or if
the data you send doesn't match what the endpoint expects.

The following example illustrates how to use the HttpContent type to send a simple
POST request containing JSON data.

```
AL
```
### Example

```
codeunit 50110 MyCodeunit
{
procedure MakeRequest(uri: Text; payload: Text) responseText: Text
var
client: HttpClient;
request: HttpRequestMessage;
response: HttpResponseMessage;
contentHeaders: HttpHeaders;
content: HttpContent;
IsSuccessful: Boolean;
begin
// Add the payload to the content
content.WriteFrom(payload);
```
```
// Replace the default content type header with a header associated
with this request
content.GetHeaders(contentHeaders);
contentHeaders.Clear();
contentHeaders.Add('Content-Type', 'application/json');
// Assigning content to request.Content will actually create a copy
of the content and assign it.
// After this line, modifying the content variable or its associated
headers will not reflect in
// the content associated with the request message
request.Content := content;
request.SetRequestUri(uri);
request.Method := 'POST';
```
```
IsSuccessful := client.Send(request, response);
if not IsSuccessful then begin
// handle the error
end;
if not response.IsSuccessStatusCode() then begin
// handle the error
end;
```

_IsEOS_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the stream has reached End of Stream; otherwise **false**.

If you are reading data from an external component, EOS can return **false** even though
no more data is available. This may occur if you have not called Read first.

## Syntax

```
IsEOS := InStream.EOS()
```

The following example opens the text file in a folder that is named MyFolder. The data
in the text file is read into and input stream variable named StreamInTest. The
InStream.EOS Method is used to determine whether the input stream has reached the
end. If the stream has not reached the end, the stream is read into a text buffer, which
indicates that the stream has not reached the end until the stream reaches the end. You
must also create the following file 'c:\MyFolder\MyText.txt'.

the varInstream variable and stores the binary data in the varChars variable. The number
of characters that is read is stored in the numChars variable. The binary data and the
number of characters that is read are displayed in a message box.

ReadText reads the stream until the specified number of bytes, the maximum length of
the string, a zero byte, or until the end of the line. For more information about how zero
bytes and line endings are read, see Write, WriteText, Read, and ReadText Method
Behavior Regarding Line Endings and Zero Terminators.

Data is read in text format.

If you do not use the optional return value and the data being read is less than the
length requested to be read, an error message is displayed.

If you use the return value, you must verify the validity of the data that has been read.

# Integer Data type

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Stores whole numbers with values that range from -2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647.

In addition to representing whole numbers in this range, you can use integers to
represent Boolean values. For Boolean values, 1 represents **true** and 0 represents **false**.

If you assign -2,147,483,648 directly to an Integer variable, then you get an error when
you try to compile the code. However, you can indirectly assign -2,147,483,648 to an
Integer variable by using the following code.

```
AL
```
If you try to indirectly assign a value that is smaller than -2,147,483,648 or larger than
2,147,483,647, then you get a run-time error.

The following are examples of integer values.

```
AL
```
The following example is a decimal and not an integer.

```

## Remarks


The operation will fail if more or less than 1 tokens are the result of evaluating the JPath.

The following example shows how to select a value from a complex JSON Object. We
build up a select expression in the query variable, we select the token corresponding to
the salary of the employee with the given employeeId, and finally, we convert the token
to a Decimal value.

We assume that the company token contains JSON data similar to the one below.

```
AL
```
### Example

```
{ "company": {
"employees": [
{ "id": "Marcy",
"salary": 8.95
},
{ "id": "John",
"salary": 7
},
{ "id": "Diana",
"salary": 10.95
}
]
}
}
```
```
local procedure SelectEmployeeSalary(companyData : JsonToken; employeeId :
Text) salary : Decimal
var
query : Text;
salaryToken : JsonToken;
begin
query := '$.company.employees[?(@.id=='''+employeeId+''')].salary';
companyData.SelectToken(query, salaryToken);
salary := salaryToken.AsValue().AsDecimal();
end;

# JsonObject.Add(Text, Text) Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Adds a new property to a JsonObject.

```
AL
```
_JsonObject_
Type: JsonObject
An instance of the JsonObject data type.

_Key_
Type: Text

_Value_
Type: Text

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

The operation will fail if the object already contains a property with the given key.

Note that text constants, such as labels or raw text values assigned in the source code,
will be transformed by the compiler. All characters that require escaping in C# strings
will be prefixed with the backslash symbol ('\'). These characters include single and

## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] JsonObject.Add(Key: Text, Value: Text)
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


double quotes, backslashes, control characters (for example, line feed or tab). For more
information, refer to String escape sequences.

In this example, the newline symbol '\n' is changed to '\\n' when the value is added to
the JSON object.

```
AL
```
When the code above is run, the variable JObj has the following value.

One way to avoid redundant escaping is to use the JsonToken.ReadFrom(Text) method

In the following example, the text value is assigned to a JsonToken variable, which is

then appended to a JsonObject. Note the double quotes in the TextValue label.

```
AL
```
### Example 1

```
local procedure AddMultilineTextValue()
var
TextValue: Label 'Multiline\nValue';
JObj: JsonObject;
begin
JObj.Add('Key', TextValue);
end;
```
```
{
"Key": "Multiline\\nValue"
}
```
### Example 2

```
local procedure AddMultilineTextValue()
var
TextValue: Label '"Multiline\nValue"';
JTok: JsonToken;
JObj: JsonObject;
begin
JTok.ReadFrom(TextValue);
JObj.Add('Key', JTok);
end;
```

#### Feedback

The value of the variable JObj after running the code of this example is as follows.

Another method is to add unescaped control characters to the AL text.

```
AL
```
In the example above, TextBuilder.AppendLine method adds unescaped characters 0x0D

and 0x0A at the end of the line, so the resulting JsonObject contains the escaped \r (^) \n
values.

{
"Key": "Multiline\nValue"
}

### Example 3

```
local procedure AddMultilineTextValue()
var
Builder: TextBuilder;
JObj: JsonObject;
begin
Builder.AppendLine('Multiline');
Builder.Append('Value');
JObj.Add('Key', Builder.ToText());
end;
```
```
{
"Key": "Multiline\r\nValue"
}

# JsonObject.SelectToken(Text, var

# JsonToken) Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Selects a JsonToken using a JPath expression.

```
AL
```
_JsonObject_
Type: JsonObject
An instance of the JsonObject data type.

_Path_
Type: Text
A valid JPath expression.

_Result_
Type: JsonToken
A JsonToken variable that will contain the result if the operation is successful.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the read was successful; otherwise, **false**. If you omit this optional return value
and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] JsonObject.SelectToken(Path: Text, var Result: JsonToken)
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


The operation will fail if more or less than 1 tokens are the result of evaluating the JPath.

The following example shows how to select a value from a complex JSON Object. We
build up a select expression in the query variable, we select the token corresponding to
the salary of the employee with the given employeeId, and finally, we convert the token
to a Decimal value.

We assume that the company token contains JSON data similar to the one below.

```
AL
```
### Example

```
{ "company": {
"employees": [
{ "id": "Marcy",
"salary": 8.95
},
{ "id": "John",
"salary": 7
},
{ "id": "Diana",
"salary": 10.95
}
]
}
}
```
```
local procedure SelectEmployeeSalary(companyData : JsonToken; employeeId :
Text) salary : Decimal
var
query : Text;
salaryToken : JsonToken;
begin
query := '$.company.employees[?(@.id=='''+employeeId+''')].salary';
companyData.SelectToken(query, salaryToken);
```
```
salary := salaryToken.AsValue().AsDecimal();
end;
```
```
７ Note
```
```
Ensure that the selected expression contains ' (single quotation mark) and not "
(double quotation mark) to decorate the string value.
```

# List Data type

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Represents a strongly typed list of ordered objects that can be accessed by index.
Contrary to the Array data type, a List is unbounded, such that its dimension does not
need to be specified upon declaration.

The following methods are available on instances of the List data type.

```
Method name Description
```
```
Add(T) Adds a value to the end of the List.
AddRange(T [, T,...]) Adds the elements of the specified collection to the end of the
list.
```
```
AddRange(List of [T]) Adds the elements of the specified collection to the end of the
list.
```
```
Contains(T) Determines whether an element is in the List.
Count() Gets the number of elements contained in the List.
```
```
Get(Integer, var T) Gets the element at the specified index.
Get(Integer) Gets the element at the specified index. This method will raise
an error if the index is outside the valid range.
```
```
GetRange(Integer, Integer) Get a shallow copy of a range of elements in the source.
GetRange(Integer, Integer, var
List of [T])
```
```
Get a shallow copy of a range of elements in the source.
```
```
IndexOf(T) Searches for the specified value and returns the one-based
index of the first occurrence within the entire List.
```
```
Insert(Integer, T) Inserts an element into the List at the specified index.
LastIndexOf(T) Searches for the specified value and returns the one-based
index of the last occurrence within the entire List.
```
## Instance methods

```
ﾉ Expand table
```

```
Method name Description
Remove(T) Removes the first occurrence of a specified value from the List.
```
```
RemoveAt(Integer) Removes the element at the specified index of the List.
RemoveRange(Integer, Integer) Removes a range of elements from the List.
```
```
Reverse() Reverses the order of the elements in the entire List.
Set(Integer, T) Sets the element at the specified index.
```
```
Set(Integer, T, var T) Sets the element at the specified index.
```
The List can only be used with simple types i.e. you can have a List of [Integer] but
cannot have a List of [Blob]. Similarly, the List data type does not support holding
instantiated records. For this purpose, use temporary tables.

Lists are 1-based indexed, that is, the indexing of a List begins with 1.

A List is a reference type, so assigning an instance of a list to another variable or passing
as a method parameter by value (for example without var), creates a second variable
that reads/writes the same list. _It does not create a new list_.

To create a new list that contains the same values as the original list, you can do the
following to perform a _shallow copy_ :

```
AL
```
A shallow copy does not copy the elements within the list, only the list itself, so if the
elements within the list are reference types as well, for example a list of lists, they will
still be the same lists as in the original list.

To perform a _deep copy_ , meaning to copy reference types within reference types, you
will need to apply the same approach to the elements of the list:

### Remarks

```
trigger OnRun()
var
l1: List of [Integer];
l2: List of [Integer];
begin
l2 := l1.GetRange( 1 , l1.Count);
end;
```

```
AL
```
In the following example, the variable CustomerNames is a list of Text values which

represent customer names. The procedure WorkWithListOfCustomers displays how one

would work with the List data type. The Add method is used to add the string 'John' to

the CustomerNames list. The Contains method is used to check whether the list contains

the specified value, in this case, the string 'John'. We continue by using the Message
procedure to display a relevant message.

```
AL
```
```
trigger OnRun()
var
innerlist: List of [Integer];
l1: List of [List of [Integer]];
l2: List of [List of [Integer]];
begin
foreach innerlist in l1 do begin
l2.Add(innerlist.GetRange( 1 , innerlist.Count));
end;
end;
```
```
２ Warning
```
```
Previously in C/AL, one would have typically used an in-memory temporary table to
create an unbounded "array" data structure, as shown in the code below. In AL you
use the List Data Type instead.
```
```
AL
```
```
listRec.Value := ‘Some Value’;
listRec.Insert();
```
### Example

```
procedure WorkWithListOfCustomers()
var
customerNames : List of [Text];
begin
// Adding an element to the list
customerNames.Add('John');
// Checking if the list contains an element
if customerNames.Contains('John') then
Message('John is in the list')
```

# Media Data type

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Encapsulates media files, such as image .jpg and .png files, in application database
tables. The Media data type can be used as a table field data type, but cannot be used
as a variable or parameter. The Media data type enables you to import a media file to
the application database and reference the file from records, making it possible to
display the media file in the client user interface. You can also export media from the
database to files and streams.

The following methods are available on the Media data type.

```

Method name Description
ExportFile(Text) Exports the media object (such as an image) that is currently used
on record to a file on your computer or network. On the record, the
media object is referenced in a Media data type field.
ExportStream(OutStream) Exports the current media object (such as a JPEG image) that is
used on record to an OUTSTREAM object. The OUTSTREAM object
can be created from a BLOB field, a FILE or from a .NET Framework
interoperability object. In the record, the media is referenced in a
Media data type field.

_[Optional] Result_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the media was successfully exported, otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional
return value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

```
７ Note
```
```
This method is supported only in Business Central on-premises.
```
## Syntax

```
[Result := ] Media.ExportFile(Filename: Text)
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


The exported media file will be of the same media type, such as JPEG (.jpg) or GIF (.gif),
as it was when imported. For more information about the media types, see Supported
Media Types.

If a file with the same name as the exported file already exists in the target folder and
the current session has write access on the file, the existing file will be automatically
replaced by the new file. If the export fails, the existing file will be erased.

This example uses the ExportFile method to export media objects that are used on
records in a sample table that is named **My Items**. Each media object is exported to a
separate file in a folder on your computer.

The example assumes that the **My Items** table already exists. Also, the table contains a
**Media** data type field that is named **Image** , and one or more records already include
media. For information about importing media, see ImportFile Method (Media) or
ImportStream Method (Media).

The code iterates over records in the **My Items** table. If a media object is referenced in
the _Image_ field, the media is exported to a file in the _C:\images_ folder. The file is given a
name in the format _ItemNN.jpg_ , where _NN_ is the number assigned to item record in the
table, as specified by the **No.** field.

```
AL
```
### Example

```
var
myItemRec: Record "My Items";
fileName: Text;
count: Integer;
Text000: Label '%1 media files were exported';
begin
if myItemRec.FindFirst() then begin
repeat begin
fileName := 'C:\images\' + 'Item' + Format(myItemRec."No.") +
'.jpg';
if myItemRec.Image.ExportFile(fileName) then
count := count + 1
end until myItemRec.Next < 1 ;

# Media.ImportFile(Text, Text [, Text])

# Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Adds a media type, such as a JPEG image, from a file to a Media data type field of a
record for displaying the media with the record in the client. The media file is imported
to the application database, and a reference to the media is included in the Media data
type field.

```
AL
```
_Media_
Type: Media
An instance of the Media data type.

_Filename_
Type: Text
Specifies the full path and name of the media file to be added.

_Description_
Type: Text
Specifies text that can be used in the client to describe the media.

_[Optional] MimeType_
Type: Text

```
７ Note
```
```
This method is supported only in Business Central on-premises.
```
## Syntax

```
[ID := ] Media.ImportFile(Filename: Text, Description: Text [, MimeType:
Text])
```
## Parameters


Specifies the media content type. MIME type is used by browsers, and is an Internet
standard to describe the contents of a file. The MimeType value must be a two-part
string that consists of a type and subtype, such as image/jpeg or image/gif. If this
parameter is not specified, the function will deduct the MIME type from the file
extension. For example the MIME type for a .jpg file is image/jpeg.

_[Optional] ID_
Type: Guid
The unique ID that is assigned to the media object in the database. You can also get the
ID by using the MediaId method. If you omit this optional return value and the
operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

You use this method to upload a media, which you want to associate with a record, to
the database. For example, you can upload an JPEG image for a record in a table. When
a media file is imported, it is assigned a unique identifier (GUID) and stored in the
system table **2000000183 Tenant Media** of the application database. The GUID is then
included in the **Media** data type field as a reference to the media file.

If you import a media file into a record that already has a media object, and a modify
operation is performed, the original media object will be permanently deleted from the
database. However, if there are other rows in the same table that reference the original
media object from the same field index, the original media object is not deleted from
the database. This behavior allows a row to be copied.

This example uses the ImportFile method to import a JPEG image from file to a record in
a database table. After the image is imported, it can be displayed on a list page that
uses the table, when the page is opened and viewed in a brick layout.

**Preparation:**

To support the example code that follows, create the following objects:

```
A table that is named My Items and has the following characteristics (as a
minimum):
```
### Return Value

### Remarks

### Example


```
An Integer data type field that has the name No..
```
```
This field is used to give an item a number.
```
```
A Media data type field that has the name Image.
```
```
This is the field on which you will import the media file.
```
```
A field group that has the name Brick and includes the No. and Image fields.
```
```
The field group is used to display the image on a page in the brick layout. For
more information, see Define fields for a drop-down control.
```
```
A page that is named My Items and has the following characteristics:
```
```
List type page that uses the My Items table as its source.
```
```
A repeater control that contains the fields of the My Items table.
```
```
Use the page to add one or more items to the table, assigning each item a number
like 1,2,3, and so on.
```
```
JPEG image files for one or more items in the My Items table.
Give each file a name that corresponds to an item number in the table, such as
1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, and so on.
Save the files in the C:\images folder on the computer that is running Dynamics
365 Business Central service.
```
**Code:**

With the objects in place, you can add and run the following AL code to import the
images. For this code example, create a codeunit and add the code to the **OnRun**
trigger of the codeunit.

The example code iterates over records in the **My Items** table. For each record, it looks
in the _C:\images_ folder for a file whose name matches the **No.** field of the record. If
there is a match, the file is imported and a message appears; otherwise, nothing
happens.

```

_FilenamePrefix_
Type: Text
Specifies the location and name of the exported media files. Each exported media file is
given a name that consists of a prefix that you specify, plus an index number that is
automatically assigned. The file name has the format prefix-index.type, for example,
Image-1.jpg, Image-2.jpg, and Image-3.jpg. To set the parameter value, use the format:
path\prefix.type.

```
path is the folder path where you want to store the files.
prefix is the text that you want before the index number.
type is the media type extension.
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method is supported only in Business Central on-premises.
```
## Syntax

```
[Count := ] MediaSet.ExportFile(FilenamePrefix: Text)
```
## Parameters

## Return Value


_[Optional] Count_
Type: Integer
The number of exported elements. If you omit this optional return value and the
operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

The exported media files will be of the same media file type as when they were
imported. For more information about the media types, see Supported Media Types.

The method has the following behavior:

```
If a file that has the same name as the exported file already is located in the target
folder and the current session has write access on the file, the existing file will be
automatically replaced by the new file.
```
```
If the export fails, the existing file will be erased.
```
```
If a media in the media set cannot be found in the database, no file will be
generated for this object.
```
This example first imports two media files (JPEG image files) from a local folder to the
media set of a record in the table **27 Item** of the CRONUS demonstration database.
Then, using the EXPORTFile method, the media objects are exported to files again in
another local folder.

For using media sets on records, the **Item** table includes a **MediaSet** data type field that
is named **Picture**.

The code imports the JPEG image files (.jpg) from the folder _C:\images_ to record _1000_ in
the **Item** table, and then exports the media files to the folder _C:\images\export_.

```
AL
```
### Remarks

### Example

```
var
itemRec: Record Item;
count: Boolean;
Text000: Label '%1 media files were exported.';

standard to describe the contents of a file. The MimeType value must be a two-part
string that consists of a type and subtype, such as image/jpeg or image/gif. If this
parameter is not specified, the function will deduct the MIME type from the file
extension. For example the MIME type for a .jpg file is image/jpeg.

_[Optional] ID_
Type: Guid
The unique ID that is assigned to the MediaSet of the record. If you omit this optional
return value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

You use this method to upload a media file as part of a collection of media objects that
you want to associate with a record. The method is similar to the ImportFile Method
(Media) except that this method enables you to import multiple media files for the same
record. For example, you can add multiple images for an item in table **27 Item**.

When a media file is imported, a media object is created and stored in the system table
**2000000181 Tenant Media** of the application database. The media object is assigned a
unique identifier (GUID).

In addition, the media object is assigned to a MediaSet which also has a specific GUID.
This GUID is included in the MediaSet data type field as a reference to the media
objects. The MediaSet and its GUID are created with the first media that is imported, and
the information is stored in table **2000000183 Tenant Media Set**. All additional media
objects for the record are then associated with the same MediaSet GUID.

This example uses the IMPORTFile method to add images to records in table **27 Item** of
the CRONUS demonstration database.

In support of the example code, you alsmust complete these tasks:

```
Create two sample image files that you want to use on item no. 1000 in table 27
Item.
```
```
Save the images as JPEG type, and give them the names 1000-v1.jpg and 1000-

archived data is not deleted.

You use this method as part of the upgrade code for an extension, where it is called
from the OnNavAppUpgradePerDatabase() or OnNavAppUpgradePerCompany() system
methods. When an extension is uninstalled, the data in application tables of the
extension is automatically stored into a set of special tables so that the data is still
preserved. With the DeleteARCHIVEDATA method, you can delete the archived data
from the application table of the new version of an extension when it is installed.

Recall a sent notification.

```
AL
```
_Notification_
Type: Notification
An instance of the Notification data type.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if it succeeds in sending a recall request to the client; otherwise **false**. The same
notification can be recalled more than once, without failing. Also, a notification can be
recalled successfully even if it hasn't been sent. If you omit this optional return value and
the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

A typical reason that the RECALL method returns **false** is a failure in the communication
with the client. Another reason could be that the code tries to recall a notification for
which there is no instance.

Denotes an option value. In the code snippet below, you can see how the Option data
type is declared.

```
AL
```
In the OptionString Property of the field or variable, you can enter the option values as a
comma-separated list. The Option type is a zero-based enumerator type, which means
that the option values are assigned to sequential numbers, starting with 0. You can
convert option data types to integers.

The following code sample shows how to define an option field in a table.

```
AL
```
## Syntax example

```
procedure HelloWithOptions(OptionParameter : Option Alpha, "Bra-vo")
var
OptionVariable : Option C, "or D";
begin
Message('%1',OptionParameter::Alpha);
Message('%1',OptionVariable::C);
end;
```
```
７ Note
```
```
It is not possible to reference the members of the OptionParameter from outside
the body of the procedure.

Write adds a zero byte at the end of the stream. This is differs from WriteText, which
does not. For more information about how zero bytes and line endings are written and
read, see Write, WriteText, Read, and ReadText Method Behavior Regarding Line Endings
and Zero Terminators.

If the optional return value, _Written_ , is not specified and it was not possible to write all
the data, an error message is displayed.

If the return value is present, you must verify that all the data was streamed.

Gets the page background task input parameters.

```
AL
```
_Parameters_
Type: Dictionary of [Text, Text]
The input parameters of the page background task.

You use this method in a page background task codeunit, which is the codeunit that
runs in a page background task. When a page background task is enqueued by the
EnqueueBackgroundTask, it can include a set of parameters (a collection of key and
value pairs) that can be used in the computations done in the background task
codeunit. These parameters are passed as a dictionary of text to the codeunit's OnRun
trigger when the page background task session is started. You use the
GetBackgroundParameters method to retrieve these parameters.

Use the Evaluate method to convert parameter values to the data types required for
calculations.

The following code is an example of a page background task codeunit that uses the
GetBackgroundParameters method to retrieve the value of the key named Wait, which

# Page.EnqueueBackgroundTask(var

# Integer, Integer [, var Dictionary of [Text,

# Text]] [, Integer] [,

# PageBackgroundTaskErrorLevel])

# Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 4.0.
```
Creates and queues a background task that runs the specified codeunit (without a UI) in
a read-only child session of the page session. If the task completes successfully, the
**OnPageBackgroundTaskCompleted** trigger is invoked. If an error occurs, the
**OnPageBackgroundTaskError** trigger is invoked. If the page is closed before the task
completes, or the page record ID on the task changed, the task is cancelled.

```
AL
```
_Page_
Type: Page
An instance of the Page data type.

_TaskId_
Type: Integer
Specifies the ID of the new page background task. The ID is assigned to the TaskId
variable after the task is queued successfully. This parameter is passed by reference to
the method.

_CodeunitId_
Type: Integer

## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] Page.EnqueueBackgroundTask(var TaskId: Integer, CodeunitId:
Integer [, var Parameters: Dictionary of [Text, Text]] [, Timeout: Integer]
[, ErrorLevel: PageBackgroundTaskErrorLevel])
```
## Parameters


Specifies the ID of the codeunit to run when the task is started.

_[Optional] Parameters_
Type: Dictionary of [Text, Text]
Specifies a collection of keys and values that are passed to the OnRun trigger of the
codeunit that runs when the page background task session is started.

_[Optional] Timeout_
Type: Integer
Specifies the number of milliseconds that the page background task can run before it is
automatically cancelled.

_[Optional] ErrorLevel_
Type: PageBackgroundTaskErrorLevel
Specifies the level of error handling on page background task level.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the page background task is successfully queued for execution; otherwise **false**. If
you omit this optional return value and the operation does not execute successfully, a
runtime error will occur.

The enqueued page background task stores the record ID of the current page. If the
current record ID on the page changes, or the page is closed, the task is canceled.
Typically, you call the EnqueueBackgroundTask method from a page trigger. The ID of
the current record of the page must remain static after the call is made and while the
background task is running. Otherwise, the task will be canceled. For this reason, we
recommend that you don't enqueue the background task from the OnOpenPage trigger.

Instead, use the OnAfterGetRecord or OnAfterGetCurrRecord triggers.

The **Child Session Max Concurrency** setting of the Business Central Server controls how
many page background tasks can be run simultaneously for a parent session. The
setting has a default value of 5. If this number is exceeded, then they'll be queued and
run when a slot becomes available as other tasks are finished. Enqueuing the task will
fail if the total number of enqueued tasks exceed the **Child Sessions Max Queue Length**
server configuration setting. For more information, see Configuring Business Central
Server - Asynchronous Processing.

### Return Value

### Remarks


When the value of the _Timeout_ parameter is exceeded, the background task is canceled
and an error with error code ChildSessionTaskTimeout occurs. On the page, the error will
appear as a notification.

The Business Central Server instance includes two configuration settings related to the
page back ground task timeout: PageBackgroundTaskDefaultTimeout and
PageBackgroundTaskMaxTimeout.

```
The PageBackgroundTaskDefaultTimeout (which has a default value of 00:02:00)
determines the timeout if the Timeout parameter isn't given a value.
```
```
The PageBackgroundTaskMaxTimeout specifies the maximum amount of time that
a page background task can run. It doesn't matter what the Timeout parameter
value is. If the Timeout value is greater than the PageBackgroundTaskMaxTimeout,
which has a default value of 00:10:00, the PageBackgroundTaskMaxTimeout value
determines the timeout.
```
For more information these settings, see Configuring Business Central Server.

It's possible to enqueue the task again in the completion trigger or error trigger, but this
pattern isn't recommended as it can lead to an endless loop. For more information, see
Page Background Tasks.

The following code extends the **Customer Card** page with a page background task by
using the EnqueueBackgroundTask method. For more information about this example,
see Page Background Tasks.

```

# Query.SaveAsCsv(Integer, Text [, Integer]

# [, Text]) Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Saves the resulting data set of a query as a comma-separated values (CSV) file.

```
AL
```
_Number_
Type: Integer
The ID of the query object. If the query that you specify does not exist, then a run-time
error occurs.

_FileName_
Type: Text
The path and name of the file that you want to save the query data set to.

_[Optional] Format_
Type: Integer
Specifies whether the columns of the resulting data set are at fixed positions in the CSV
file or separated only by a delimiter.

_[Optional] FormatArgument_
Type: Text
You set the FormatArgument parameter based on the setting of the Format parameter.

```
７ Note
```
```
This method is supported only in Business Central on-premises.
```
## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] Query.SaveAsCsv(Number: Integer, FileName: Text [, Format:
Integer] [, FormatArgument: Text])
```
## Parameters


If the Format parameter is set to 0, then the FormatArgument parameter specifies the
starting position of each column in the data set. The value is a comma separated string
of integers that includes an integer for every column. In a CSV file, each line is evenly
divided into positions for holding characters. The first integer corresponds to the
starting position of the first column, the second integer corresponds to the starting
position of the second column, and so on.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the SaveAsCsv succeeded, otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return value
and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

A CSV file stores data in a plain text format. When you save a query dataset as a CSV file,
each row of the dataset is stored on a separate line in the file, and each column in a row
is separated by a comma or another delimiter of your choice. The first line of the file will
contain the column names of the query. A query column name is specified by its Name
Property.

When the **SaveAsCSV** method is called the query dataset is generated and then saved in
CSV format to the file that is designated by the _FileName_ parameter.

To apply filters with the **SetFilter** and **SetRange** methods, the SaveAsCSV method must
be called after **SetFilter** and **SetRange** methods, as shown in the following example.

The **SaveAsCSV** method can be called at any place in the code and does not require that
the **Close** , **Open** or **Read** methods are called before it. When the **SaveAsCSV** method is
called, a new instance of the query is created. The query is implicitly opened, read, and
closed. If there is currently a dataset in the opened state when the **SaveAsCSV** method is

### Return Value

### Remarks

```
// Sets a filter on the Quantity column of the query
Query.SetFilter(Quantity, '>50');
// Opens a new query that is filtered by the SetFilter method and saves the
dataset
Query.SaveAsCSV('c:\test.csv');
```

called, then that instance is closed. This means that the following code is illegal because
the query is not open on the second **Read** call.

```
AL
```
The correct code for this example is as follows.

```
AL
```
The following example shows how to save the dataset of a query with the name **My
Customers Query** as a CSV file. The file is given the name **mycustomers.csv** and is saved
on the c: drive of the computer running Dynamics 365 Business Central service. The
query consists of three columns: No., Name, and City. The file is set to place the columns
at the following positions: 1, 10, and 40.

This example requires that you create a query called **My Customer Query** that is based
on table **18 Customer** and contains the **No** , **Name** , and **City** columns.

```
AL
```
The following code shows an example of the content of the saved file.

```
Query.Open;
Query.Read;
Query.SaveAsCSV('c:\test.csv');
Query.Read;
```
```
Query.Open;
Query.Read;
Query.SaveAsCSV('c:\test.csv');
Query.Open;
Query.Read;
```
### Example

```
var
MyCustomerQuery: Query "My Customer Query";
OK: Boolean;
Text000: Label 'Query was not saved.';
begin
OK := MyCustomerQuery.SaveAsCSV('c:\mycustomers.csv', 0 , '1,10,40');
if not OK then
Error(Text000);

# Query.Close() Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Closes a query data set and returns the query instance to the initialized state. The
following code shows the syntax of the CLOSE method. Query is a variable of the Query
data type that specifies the query object.

```
AL
```
_Query_
Type: Query
An instance of the Query data type.

The **Close** method does not clear any filters that are set by the SetFilterS method. If you
want to clear the filters, then you must call the Clear method.

In most cases, you do not have to call the **Close** method explicitly. The **Close** method is
called implicitly when the following conditions are true:

```
When the query variable goes out of scope.
```
```
When the Open method is called on a dataset that is currently open.
```
```
When the SetFilter Method (Query) or SetRange Method (Query) are called on a
dataset that is currently open.

## Syntax

```
Query.Close()

The following example demonstrates how to use the **Close** method on a query. The
example code sets filters on the query, opens the query, and then reads the dataset. For
each row in the dataset, a message box is displayed that contains the values of the
columns in the row.

This example requires that you create a query called **Customer_SalesQuantity** that is
links table **18 Customer** with table **37 Sales Lines** from the CRONUS International Ltd.
demonstration database. Include columns for the **Name** and **No.** fields from the
Customer table and the **Quantity** field from Sales Lines table.

The following AL code opens the query, reads each row of the dataset, and then closes
the query. You can add the code to a codeunit, and then run the codeunit to see the
results.

# Query.GetFilter(Any) Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Returns the filters that are set on the field of a specified column in the query. The
following code shows the syntax of the GETFILTER method. Query is a variable of the
Query data type that specifies the query object.

```
AL
```
_Query_
Type: Query
An instance of the Query data type.

_Column_
Type: Any
The name of the column in the query. A column name is defined by the Name Property.

_Filter_
Type: Text
The filters of the column.

The **GetFilter** method returns the filters that are currently set for a data column or filter
row by the SetFilter Method (Query) method, SetRange Method (Query) method, and
the column's ColumnFilter Property. The **GetFilter** method does not return filters that
are set on a column's source field by the DataItemTableFilter Property or global filters
that are set by the **FilterGroup** method.

## Syntax

```
Filter := Query.GetFilter(Column: Any)
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


You can call the **GetFilter** method multiple times and at any point in the code. If you call
the **GetFilter** method before the **SetFilter** or **SetRange** method, then the **GetFilter**
method returns only filters on the column that are set by the column's ColumnFilter
property.

Filters that are set by the **SetFilter** method and **SetRange** method are applied to a query
when the query is opened with a call to the **Open** , **SaveAsXML** , or **SaveAsCSV** methods.
You must consider the location of the **GetFilterS** method with respect to these methods
to obtain the desired results. For example, in the following two code examples, the
**GetFilter** method will return the filter that is set by the **SetFilter** method. However, in the
first example, the filter has been applied to the query dataset; in the second example,
the filter has not been applied.

```
AL
```
```
AL
```
The following AL code example demonstrates how to use the **GetFilter** method on a
query. The example code sets a filter on a query column, and then displays a message
when the query is run that indicates the filter on the column.

This example requires that you create a query called **Customer_SalesQuantity** that has
the following characteristics:

```
Links table 18 Customer with table 37 Sales Lines from the CRONUS International
Ltd. demonstration database.
```
```
Includes columns for the Name and No. fields from the Customer table and the
Quantity field from Sales Lines table.
```
```
The ColumnFilter property of the Quantity column is set to include values greater
than 5.
```
```
Query.SetFilter(Column, String);
Query.Open;
Query.GetFilter(Column);
Query.Read;
```
```
Query.Open;
Query.SetFilter(Column, String);
Query.GetFilter(Column);

## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


on a column's source field by the DataItemTableFilter Property or global filters that are
set by the **FilterGroup** method.

You can call the **GetFilterS** method multiple times and at any point in the code. If you
call the **GetFilterS** method before the first **SetFilter** or **SetRange** method call, then the
**GetFilterS** method returns only filters that are set by the **ColumnFilter** property of the
columns.

Filters that are set by the **SetFilter** method and **SetRange** method are applied to a query
when the query is opened by using a call to the **Open** , the **SaveAsXML** , or **SaveAsCSV**
methods. You must consider the location of the **GetFilterS** method with respect to these
methods to obtain the results that you want. For example, in the following two code
examples, the **GetFilterS** method will return the filter set by the **SetFilter** method call.
However, in the first example, the filter has been applied to the query dataset; in the
second example, the filter has not been applied.

```
AL
```
```
AL
```
The following AL code example demonstrates how to use the **GetFilterS** method on a
query. The example code sets filters on a query column, and then displays a message
when the query is run that indicates the filter on the column.

This example requires that you create a query called **Customer_SalesQuantity** that has
the following characteristics:

```
Links table 18 Customer with table 37 Sales Lines from the CRONUS International
Ltd. demonstration database.
```
```
Includes columns for the Name and No. fields from the Customer table and the
Quantity field from Sales Lines table.
```
```
Query.SetFilter(Column, String);
Query.Open;
Query.GetFilterS;
Query.Read;
```
```
Query.Open;
Query.SetFilter(Column, String);
Query.GetFilterS;
Query.Read;
```

# Query.Open() Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Runs a query object and generates a data set that can be read. The following code
shows the syntax of the OPEN method. Query is a variable of the Query data type that
specifies the query object.

```
AL
```
_Query_
Type: Query
An instance of the Query data type.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

When the **Open** method is called, the query is executed and the _Query_ variable is put in
a state in which the resulting dataset can be read by the **Read** method. The **Open**
method has the following behavior:

```
To apply filters for the SetFilterS method or SetRange method, you call the
SetFilterS method or SetRange method before the Open method.
```
## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] Query.Open()
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


To read a row from the dataset, you must call the **Open** method before the **Read**
method, as shown in the following code example.

```
AL
```
To close an open query and return it to the initialized state, you can call the **Close**
method. However, you can call the **Open** method multiple times without calling
the **Close** method because the **Open** method implicitly calls the **Close** method if
the query dataset is currently in an opened state.

If the **Open** method is called on a query that is already in the opened or in the
reading state, then the query dataset is closed, and then the query is executed
again. To continue to loop through the dataset, the **Read** method must be called
again. The next **Read** method call returns the first row in the dataset, as shown in
the following code example.

```
AL
```
**Open** method does not clear any filters that were set by the **SetFilter** or **SetRange**
methods on a previous **Open** call. If you want to clear the filters, then you must call
the **Clear** method on the query variable.

```
AL
```
You are required to call the **Open** method before the SaveAsXML Method or
SaveAsCSV Method. The **SaveAsXML** and **SaveAsCSV** methods automatically close

```
Query.SetFilter(Column1, String);
Query.Open;
Query.Read;
```
```
// Opens the query and generates a dataset.
Query.Open;
Query.Read;
// Closes the query and reopens it.
Query.Open;
// Reads the first row in the new dataset.
Query.Read;
```
```
Query.SetFilter(Column1, String);
Query.Open;
Query.Read;
Clear(query);
Query.Open;
Query.Read;
```

```
the current query dataset and initialize a new instance of the query.
```
The following example demonstrates how to use the **Open** method on a query. The
example code sets filters on the query, opens the query, and then reads the dataset. For
each row in the dataset, a message box is displayed that contains the values of the
columns in the row.

This example requires that you create a query called **Customer_SalesQuantity** that links
table **18 Customer** with table **37 Sales Lines** from the CRONUS International Ltd.
demonstration database. Include columns for the **Name** and **No.** fields from the
Customer table and the **Quantity** field from Sales Lines table.

The following AL code opens the query, reads each row of the dataset, and then displays
a message that uses the content of the row. You can add the code to a codeunit, and
then run the codeunit to see the results.

```
AL
```
When the code is run, a message that resembles the following appears for each row in
the dataset:

**Customer name = The Device Shop, Quantity = 30**

### Example

```
var
MyQuery: Query "Customer SalesQuantity";
Text000: Label 'Customer name = %1, Quantity = %2';
begin
// Sets a filter to display only sales quantities greater than 20.
MyQuery.SetFilter(Quantity, '>20');
// Runs the query.
MyQuery.Open;
// Reads each row in the dataset and displays a message with column
values.
// Stops reading when there are no more rows remaining in the dataset
(Read is False).
while MyQuery.Read do
begin
Message(Text000, MyQuery.Name, MyQuery.Quantity);
end;
MyQuery.Close;
end;

# Query.Read() Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Reads data from a row in the resulting data set of a query.

```
AL
```
_Query_
Type: Query
An instance of the Query data type.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

When the **Read** method is called, the next row in the dataset query is retrieved. While in
the reading state, values of columns in the row can be accessed by calling
_Query.ColumnName_ , where _Query_ is the query type variable that specifies the query
object and _ColumnName_ is the column of the query.

To read a row in the dataset, you must call the **Open** method before the **Read** method.
After the **Read** method call, columns can be accessed as shown in the following code
example.

```
AL
```
## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] Query.Read()
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


You can call the **Read** method multiple times after the **Open** method to read
consecutive rows in the dataset. The first **Read** method call retrieves the first row from
the resulting dataset and each subsequent **Read** method retrieves the next row from the
dataset. For example, the second **Read** method call retrieves the second row, the third
**Read** method call retrieves the third row, and so on.

```
AL
```
The following example demonstrates how to use the **Read** method on a query. The
example code sets filters on the query, opens the query, and then reads the dataset. For
each row in the dataset, a message box is displayed that contains the values of the
columns in the row.

This example requires that you create a query called **Customer_SalesQuantity** that is
links table **18 Customer** with table **37 Sales Lines** from the CRONUS International Ltd.
demonstration database. Include columns for the **Name** and **No.** fields from the
Customer table and the **Quantity** field from Sales Lines table.

The following AL code opens the query, reads each row of dataset, and then displays a
message that has the content of the row. You can add the code to a codeunit, and then

```
query.Open;
query.Read;
query.ColumnName
```
```
Query.Open;
// Reads the first row in the dataset.
Query.Read;
// Accesses a column in the first row of the dataset.
Query.ColumnName
// Reads the second row in the dataset.
Query.Read;
// Accesses a column in the first row of the dataset.
Query.ColumnName
```
```
７ Note
```
```
If the Read method is called and there are no more rows in the dataset, then the
Read method returns false.

_[Optional] Value_
Type: Any
Replacement values to insert in replacement fields in the filter expression. The data type
of Value must match the data type of field that is referred to by the ColumnName.

## Syntax

```
Query.SetFilter(Column: Any, String: Text [, Value: Any,...])
```
## Parameters

## Remarks


To apply filters to a dataset, the **SetFilter** method must be called before the **Open** ,
**SaveAsXML** , and **SaveAsCSV** methods, as shown in the following example. To remove
filters from query, you call the Clear Method.

```
AL
```
A call to the **SetFilter** method automatically closes a query dataset that is currently
open. Therefore, the following code is unauthorized and will fail because there is no
open dataset for the **Read** method to read.

```
AL
```
You can have multiple calls to the **SetFilter** method. If **SetFilter** method calls set filters
on different columns, then the filters are combined and applied to the dataset. If
consecutive **SetFilter** method calls set filters on the same column, then the last **SetFilter**
method call is applied to the column.

In addition to the **SetFilter** method, you can apply filters to a query using the SetRange
Method (Query) method, the **FilterGroup** method, and the DataItemTableFilter Property
and ColumnFilter Property.

```
If the SetFilter method... then...
```
```
Sets a filter on the same field as the
DataItemTableFilter property
```
```
The two filters are joined into a resulting filter.
```
```
Sets a filter on the same field as the
ColumnFilter property
```
```
The SetFilter method overwrites the ColumnFilter
property, so the filter that is set by the SetFilter
method that is applied to the dataset.
Sets a filter on the same field as the
SetRange method
```
```
The method that is called last is applied to the
dataset.
```
```
Query.SetFilter(Column1, String);
Query.Open;
Query.Read;
Clear(Query);
```
```
Query.Open;
Query.Read;
Query.SetFilter(Column2, String);
Query.Read;
```
```
ﾉ Expand table
```

```
If the SetFilter method... then...
Sets a filter on a field that has global
filters that are applied by the
FilterGroup(1) method
```
```
The filters of the SetFilter method are added to the
global filters.
```
For example, a query has the following filters set on the **Quantity** column:

```
DataItemTableFilter property: Quantity=Filter(<100)
```
```
ColumnFilter property: Quantity=Filter(<>50)
```
```
Query.SetFilter ("Quantity", '>1') will result in a filter that is equivalent to:
```
1<Quantity <100.

The following AL code example demonstrates how to use the **SetFilter** method on a
query. The example code sets a filter on a query column, and then displays a message
when the query is run that indicates the filter on the column.

This example requires that you create a query called **Customer_SalesQuantity** that has
the following characteristics:

```
Links table 18, Customer with table 37, Sales Lines from the CRONUS International
Ltd. demonstration database.
```
```
Includes columns for the Name and No. fields from the Customer table and the
Quantity field from Sales Lines table.
```
```
AL
```
### Example

```
var
MyQuery: Query "Customer SalesQuantity";
Text000: Label 'Customer name = %1, Quantity = %2';
begin
// Sets a filter to display only sales quantities greater than 10.
MyQuery.SetFilter(Quantity, '>10');
// Sets a filter to display the columns with the value Selangorian Ltd.
only.
MyQuery.SetFilter(NAME, 'Selangorian Ltd.');
// Runs the query.
MyQuery.Open;
// Reads each row in the dataset and displays message with column
values.
// Stops reading when there are no more rows remaining in the dataset
(Read is False).

# Query.SetRange(Any [, Any] [, Any])

# Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Sets a filter on a range of values on a column of a query data set.

```
AL
```
_Query_
Type: Query
An instance of the Query data type.

_Column_
Type: Any
The name of the column in the query that you want to filter. The name is defined by the
column's Name Property.

_[Optional] FromValue_
Type: Any
The lower limit of the range. The data type of this parameter must match the data type
of Column. If you set only the FromValue parameter, then the ToValue parameter is set
to the same value as FromValue.

_[Optional] ToValue_
Type: Any
The upper limit of the range. The data type of this parameter must match the data type
of Column. If you omit the ToValue parameter, then the only the value that is specified
for FromValue is used, which enables you to filter on a single column value instead of a
range. If you omit both the FromValue and ToValue parameters, then the method
removes all filters that are already set on the column.

## Syntax

```
Query.SetRange(Column: Any [, FromValue: Any] [, ToValue: Any])
```
## Parameters


SetRange is a quick way to set a simple filter on a field. The SetRange method is
functionally equivalent to calling _Query_ .SetFilter(ColumnName, 'FromValue..ToValue').

To apply filters to a dataset, the **SetRange** method must be called before the **Open** ,
**SaveAsXML** , and **SaveAsCSV** methods, as shown in the following example. To remove
filters, you call the Clear Method or **SetRange** without values for the _FromValue_ and
_ToValue_ parameters.

```
AL
```
A call to the **SetRange** method automatically closes a query dataset that is currently
open. Therefore, the following code is unauthorized and will fail because there is no
open dataset for the **Read** method to read.

```
AL
```
In addition to the **SetRange** method, you can apply filters to a query using the **SetFilter**
method and the DataItemTableFilter Property and ColumnFilter Property.

```
If the SetRange method... then...
Sets a filter on the same field as the
DataItemTableFilter property
```
```
The two filters are joined into a resulting filter.
```
```
Sets a filter on the same field as the
ColumnFilter property
```
```
The SetRange method overwrites the ColumnFilter
property, so the filter that is set by the SetRange
method that is applied to the dataset.
```
```
Sets a filter on the same field as the
SetFilter method
```
```
The method that is called last is applied to the
dataset.
```
### Remarks

```
Query.SetRange(Column1, FromValue, ToValue);
Query.Open;
Query.Read;
Clear(Query);
```
```
Query.Open;
Query.Read;
Query.SetRange(Column1, FromValue, ToValue);
Query.Read;
```
```
ﾉ Expand table
```

```
If the SetRange method... then...
Sets a filter on a field that has global
filters that are applied by the
FilterGroup(1) method
```
```
The filters of the SetRange method are added to the
global filters.
```
For example, a query has the following filters set on the **Quantity** column:

```
DataItemTableFilter property: Quantity=Filter(<>10)
```
```
ColumnFilter property: Quantity=Filter(<>5)
```
```
Query.setRange(Quantity, 1, 15) will result in a filter that is equivalent to: 1 < Quantity
```
<15, except for 10.

The following AL code example demonstrates how to use the **SetRange** method on a
query. The example code sets a filter on a query column and saves the resulting dataset
as a CSV file. A message also displays when the query is run that indicates the filter on
the column.

This example requires that you do the following:

1. Create a query called **Customer_SalesQuantity** that has the following

# Query.TopNumberOfRows([Integer])

# Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Specifies the maximum number of rows to include in the resulting data set of a query.

```
AL
```
_Query_
Type: Query
An instance of the Query data type.

_[Optional] NewRows_
Type: Integer
The number of rows to include in the resulting data set. If you do not set the NewRows
parameter, then the resulting data set will include all rows. If you set the value to 0, then
there is no limit and all rows of the data set are returned.

_[Optional] CurrentRows_
Type: Integer
Gets the current maximum number of rows included in the resulting data set

## Syntax

```
[CurrentRows := ] Query.TopNumberOfRows([NewRows: Integer])
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked using property access syntax.
```
## Parameters

## Return Value


You use the **TopNumberOfRows** method to limit the resulting dataset to the first set of
rows that are generated for the query. For example, you can include only the first 10 or
first 100 rows in the resulting dataset. The **TopNumberOfRows** method is useful for key
performance indicators such as the top number of customers or sales.

You can also specify the number of rows to include in the dataset by setting the
TopNumberOfRows Property. The **TopNumberOfRows** method will overwrite the
**TopNumberOfRows** property setting.

This code example demonstrates how to use the **TopNumberOfRows** method on a
query to return the top 10 customer sales orders based on the quantity of items.

The following query object links table **18 Customer** and table **37 Sales Line** and uses the
**TopNumberOfRows** property to get top 5 customer sales orders based on the quantity
of items.

```
AL
```
### Remarks

### Example

```
query 50123 "Customer_Sales_Quantity"
{
QueryType = Normal;
// Sets the resultS to include the top 5 the results in descending order
TopNumberOfRows = 5 ;
OrderBy = descending(Qty);
```
```
elements
{
dataitem(C; Customer)
{
column(Customer_Number; "No.")

Depending on the runtime version, the runtime may require extra fields to be selected
for loading. Which extra fields to specify depends on the state of the record and table or
table extension definition. For example, fields that are filtered upon are always loaded.

This method is part of the partial records capability for improving performance. For
more information, see Using Partial Records.

The following example code shows how to use the AddLoadFields method to add a field
for loading on a report. The example loads a field that is outside of the default fields
selected by DataColumns of the report. The field is added by using the AddLoadFields
on the OnPreDataItem trigger.

# Record.CalcFields(Any [, Any,...]) Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Calculates the FlowFields in a record. You specify which fields to calculate by using
parameters.

```
AL
```
_Record_
Type: Record
An instance of the Record data type.

_Field1_
Type: Any

_[Optional] Field2_
Type: Any

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

FlowFields are virtual fields. The values in these fields are not saved in the table. This
means that you must use either the **CalcFields** method or the SetAutoCalcFields Method
(Record) to update them. For example, if you retrieve a record using the Find Method

## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] Record.CalcFields(Field1: Any [, Field2: Any,...])
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


(Record) and Next Method (Record), the FlowFields in those records are set to zero (0).
Then, when you call **CalcFields** , their values are updated.

When a FlowField is a direct source expression on a page or a report, the calculation is
performed automatically.

You can also use the **CalcFields** method to retrieve binary large objects (BLOBs). For
more information, see BLOB Data Type.

Dynamics 365 Business Central automatically maintains a count for all SIFT indexes.
Therefore, SumIndexField Technology (SIFT) is used by default when the calculation
method for a FlowField is **Count** or **Average**.

You can prevent the SIFT indexes from being updated by setting the MaintainSIFTIndex
Property of the index in the base table to **False**. Then Business Central will traverse all
records in the base table to perform the calculation instead of using SIFT. This can
reduce the number of required SIFT indexes, which can improve performance. For more
information, see SIFT and Performance.

In Dynamics 365 Business Central, an index is not required to support a certain sorting,
but sorting without an index could lead to bad performance if a search returns a large
result set, which would then have to be sorted before the first row is returned.

This example shows how to use the **CalcFields** method to find the balance on December
31, 2008 and the net change for a customer in 2008.

```
AL
```
The first line sets up a filter for the Date Filter field in the Customer record. This field is a
FlowFilter field which is used in the filter definition for several FlowFields in the
Customer record. In the second line, the FlowFields are calculated.

### Example

```
var
CustomerRec: Record Customer;
begin
CustomerRec.SetRange("Date Filter", 20080101 D, 20081231 D);
CustomerRec.CalcFields(Balance, "Net Change");
end;

Even if you run the **ChangeCompany** method, triggers still run in the current company,
not in the company that you specified in the **ChangeCompany** method.

This example shows how to use the **ChangeCompany** method. The following code takes
a Customer record in the current company and redirects it to the table in another
company - in this case Company B. The last record in the Customer table of Company B
is then deleted.

{
trigger OnRun()
var
RecID: RecordID;
MyRecord: Record Customer;
Text000: Label 'Record to be deleted: %1';
begin
MyRecord.ChangeCompany('Company B');
MyRecord.FindLast;
RecID := MyRecord.RecordId;

# Record.Consistent(Boolean) Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Marks a table as being consistent or inconsistent.

```
AL
```
_Record_
Type: Record
An instance of the Record data type.

_Consistent_
Type: Boolean
The mark to be set on the table. If this parameter is true, the table is marked as
consistent. If this parameter is false, the table is marked as inconsistent.

Usually this method is only used for accounting routines. If your accounts do not
balance, then the accounts are inconsistent. This method makes sure that inconsistent
changes are not made in your accounts.

If an attempt is made to commit a write transaction when a table is marked as
inconsistent, then a message is displayed and all updates that were made in the write
transaction are ended.

A typical example of an inconsistency occurs when the sum of all the entries in a table
that contains general ledger entries does not balance - is not equal to zero.

In this example, your application includes a method object that is named
**ChangeAmount**. This method is used to withdraw amounts that were put into the

## Syntax

```
Record.Consistent(Consistent: Boolean)
```
## Parameters

## Remarks


**General Ledger Entry** table in your application. When an amount is withdrawn from an
account, the system is inconsistent until a corresponding amount is put in. The following
code example illustrates the **ChangeAmount** method. The **ChangeAmount** method has
one parameter, Amount, which is a Decimal data type.

```
AL
```
The method uses the variable Balance to express the change in balance. For example,

when the method is used to withdraw $100, the Balance variable will reflect this as

-$100.

When you use the method to put in one or more amounts whose total equals +$100,
the Balance variable then equals zero and the table is marked as consistent. This means

that if an attempt is made to put in an amount and end the write transaction - commit
the change - without withdrawing a corresponding amount, an error occurs and the
write transaction is canceled.

### Example

```
var
GLEntry: Record "G/L Entry";
Balance: Decimal;
Amount: Decimal;
Consistent: Boolean;
```
```
begin
GLEntry."G/L Account No." := '1000';
GLEntry.Amount := Amount;
GLEntry.Insert;
Balance := Balance + Amount;
if Balance = 0 then
Consistent := true
else
Consistent := false;
GLEntry.Consistent(Consistent);

Type: Boolean
Specifies whether the method copies filters, views, automatically calculated FlowFields,
marks, fields, and keys of the record or creates a reference to a temporary record. If
FromRecord and Record are both temporary and ShareTable is true, then the COPY
method causes Record to reference the same table as FromRecord. If ShareTable is true,
then both Record and FromRecord must be temporary; otherwise an error will occur.
The default value is false. If you specify false, only filters, marks, and keys are copied.

```
It's possible to use one of the internally used groups. If you do this, you
replace the filter that Dynamics 365 Business Central assumes is in this group.
```

A filter group can contain a filter for a Record that has been set earlier with the SetFilter
Method (Record) or the SetRange Method (Record). The total filter applied is the
combination of all the filters set in all the filtergroups.

When you select a filter group, subsequent filter settings by the SetFilter Method
(Record) or the SetRange Method (Record) apply to that group.

All groups are active at all times. The only way to turn off a group is to remove the filters
set in that group.

Filters in different groups are all effective simultaneously. For example, if in one group, a
filter is set on customer numbers 1000 to 2000, while in another group, a filter is set on
customer numbers 1800 to 3000, then only numbers in the range 1800 to 2000 are
visible.

If you have filters on _multiple fields in the same filter group_ , then only records matching
all filters are visible. The only exception to this is filtergroup -1 where records only need
to match at least one of the filters.

Dynamics 365 Business Central uses the following filter groups internally. These
filtergroups shouldn't be used.

```
Number Name Description
-1 Cross-
column
```
```
Used to support the cross-column search.
```
```
If, for example, you use filter group 4 in a page, you will replace the filtering
that is actually the result of applying the SubPageLink Property. This could
seriously alter the way pages and subpages interact.
For performance reasons, filtergroup -1 does not support filtering on
flowfields.
The maximum number of filtergroups is 255. Greater numbers will be
ignored, so don't use them.
```
```
） Important
```
```
Using filter group 7 may cause factboxes to not work as intended.
```
```
ﾉ Expand table
```

```
Number Name Description
0 Std The default group where filters are placed when no other group has
been selected explicitly. This group is used for filters that can be set from
the filter dialogs by the end user.
1 Global Used for filters that apply globally to the entire application.
```
```
2 Form Used for the filtering actions that result from the following:
```
- SetTableView Method (XMLport), SetTableView Method (Page)
- SourceTableView Property
- DataItemTableView Property.
3 Exec Used for the filtering actions that result from the following:
- SubPageView Property
- RunPageView Property
4 Link Used for the filtering actions that result from the following:
- DataItemLink Property (Reports)
- SubPageLink Property

```
5 Temp Not currently used.
6 Security Used for applying security filters for user permissions.
```
```
7 Factboxes Used for clearing the state of factboxes.
```
A filter set in a group different from filter group 0 cannot be changed by a user that
uses a filter dialog to set a filter. If, for example, a filter has been set on customer
numbers 1000 to 2000 in group 4, then the user can set a filter that delimits this
selection further, but cannot widen it to include customer numbers outside the range
1000 to 2000.

To reset the filters in filter group 1, you add an empty filter to the group. To add an
empty filter, to filter group 1, you must first set the filter group.

```
AL
```
Then, for each field in the table that to which the Rec variable refers, set an empty filter.

###### Reset filter

```
Rec.FilterGroup( 1 );
```

```
AL
```
The following example uses the SetFilter Method (Record) to set a filter that selects
records with No. field between 10000 and 20000. Then, the **FilterGroup** method returns
the number for the filter group. No filter group was selected explicitly, so the filter is set
in filter group 0. This value is stored in the varOrigGroup variable and displayed in a
message box. Next, the **FilterGroup** method changes the filter group to 1. The new
value is stored in the varCurrGroup variable and displayed in a message box.

```
AL
```
The following example finds all customers where the Customer Name or Contact Name

# Record.Find([Text]) Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Finds a record in a table that is based on the values stored in keys.

```
AL
```
_Record_
Type: Record
An instance of the Record data type.

_[Optional] Which_
Type: Text
Specifies how to perform the search. The table is searched until either a record is found
or there are no more records. Each character in this string can be present only one time.
You can combine the '=', '<', and '>' characters. You can use the following characters:

```
=  to search for a record that equals the key values (default)
>  to search for a record that is larger than the key values
<  to search for a record that is less than the key values
+  to search for the last record in the table (+ can only be used alone)
-   to search for the first record in the table (- can only be used alone) If this
parameter contains '=', '>' or '<', then you must assign value to all fields of the
current and primary keys before you call FIND.
```
_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] Record.Find([Which: Text])
```
## Parameters

## Return Value


Find retrieves the first record that meets the conditions set by _Which_ and the filters
associated with _Record_. The search path reflects the sort order defined by the current
key. If the current key is not the primary key, several records might have the same values
in current key fields. If this occurs, the sort order defined by the primary key as the
search path is used.

Calling Find on an empty table from the OnNewRecord trigger causes the Business
Central Server to throw an exception, and the AL execution stops. However, the client
suppresses this error and does not show any error message to the user. Therefore, when
using Find inside this trigger, you should add code that conditionally verifies whether a
record was found, and if not, notify the user with a message. For example:

```
AL
```
The following example shows how use the **Find** method to find a record in a table. The
code sets the number of the record to find to 1100, which is the primary key of the
record to find. The **Find** method uses the '=' parameter to find the record that has a
primary value that equals the specified primary key. If the record is found, then the item
number, description, and unit price of the item are displayed in a message box.
Otherwise, a message that specifies that the item is not found is displayed.

```
AL
```
### Remarks

```
if not MyRecord.Find then
Error('error message');
```
### Example 1

```
begin
ItemRec."No." := '1100';
if ItemRec.Find('=') then
Message(Text000, ItemRec."No.", ItemRec.Description, ItemRec."Unit
Price")
else
Message(Text001);
end;
```
```
var
ItemRec: Record Item;
Text000: Label 'Item No. %1.\Description: %2. Price: $%3.';
Text001: Label 'The item was not found.';
```

The following example defines a record variable that is named ItemRec. The **Find**
method uses the '+' parameter to find the last record in the table. If the record is found,
then the item number, description, and unit price of the item are displayed in a message
box. Otherwise, the message that specifies that the item was not found is displayed.

# Record.FindFirst() Method

```
Finds the first record in a table based on the current key and filter.

```
AL
```
_Record_
Type: Record
An instance of the Record data type.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

This method should be used instead of **Find** ('-') when you only need the first record.

You should only use this method when you explicitly want to find the first record in a
table or set. Do not use this method in combination with **Repeat** .. **Until**.

Calling FindFirst on an empty table from the OnNewRecord trigger causes the Business
Central Server to throw an exception, and the AL execution stops. However, the client
suppresses this error and does not show any error message to the user. Therefore, when
using FindFirst inside this trigger, you should add code that conditionally verifies

# Record.FindSet([Boolean]) Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Finds a set of records in a table based on the current key and filter.

```
AL
```
_Record_
Type: Record
An instance of the Record data type.

_[Optional] ForUpdate_
Type: Boolean
Set this parameter to true if you want to modify any records in the set; otherwise, set the
parameter to false. If you set this parameter to true, then the records will be read with
Updlock. If you set this parameter to false, then you can still modify the records in the
set, but these updates will not be performed optimally. The default value is false.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

You should use this method only when you explicitly want to loop through a recordset.
You should only use this method in combination with repeat..until.

## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] Record.FindSet([ForUpdate: Boolean])
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


The difference between Find() and FindSet is that Find uses paging and the method

only requests N rows in the first request, and then if you need more rows, it'll submit a
new SQL request. The FindSet method will request all rows at once.

The difference between FindSet(false) and FindSet(true) is that FindSet(true) will do
a LockTable() before finding rows, which is an advantage if you plan to update all the

rows you are finding.

This method works the same way as the FindSet Method (RecordRef).

The following examples are meant for illustration purposes of the usage of the FindSet
method only and are not meant to illustrate best practices.

This example shows how to use the FindSet method to loop through a set without

updating it, only running a validation on each record. This example requires a
VATRegistrationValidation method, which is not included in this example:

Get doesn't require specifying all fields of the key in the call; any omitted field is
treated as default value (for example, ‘’ for text/code, false for boolean). You can
only omit from the end of the key, not a field in the middle of a key. If a record with
a blank/default value exists that is the one being returned, otherwise it will fail with
a record doesn't exist error.
```
```
７ Note
```
```
You can't use the Get method to retrieve a record in a table by its primary key value
if the primary key field in the table has the data type RecordID. This is because
RecordId already is the primary key itself and not one of the fields that forms it, as
the method expects. In this case, you can retrieve the record by using the SetRange
Method.
```
```
７ Note

If the retrieval of the record fails for other reasons than it not existing a runtime
error will still occur, even if you're using the return value.

_Record_
Type: Record
An instance of the Record data type.

This method assigns default values to each field in the record, including the SystemId
field when a table is created. For any new field added later into the record, values are
initialized by default or by using InitValue Property (Record). If no value was assigned
when the table was created, the values are assigned based on the data type, as shown in
the following table.

```
Data type Default value

```
BigInteger 0
BigText <Empty>
```
```
BLOB <Empty>
Boolean No
```
```

Record.Init()
```
## Parameters

## Remarks

```
ﾉ Expand table
```

```
Data type Default value
Date 0d (Undefined date)
```
```
DateFormula '' (empty string)
DateTime 0DT (Undefined datetime)
```

Integer 0
```
```
Option 0
RecordID <Empty>
```
```
TableFilter <Empty>
Text '' (empty string)
```
```
Time 0T (Undefined time)
```
After the method runs, you can change the values in any or all of the fields before you
call the Insert Method (RecordRef) to enter the record in the table. Be sure that the fields
that make up the primary key contain values that make the total primary key unique. If
the primary key isn't unique (such as the record already exists), then the record is
rejected.

The method works in the same way as the Init Method (RecordRef).

```
７ Note
```
```
Primary key and timestamp fields are not initialized.
```
```
７ Note
```
```
You aren't required to call the Init() method every time you intend to insert a
record as, the fields are already populated, either with default values or the values
set by the InitValue property. For the use cases, where the values need to be
refreshed with each iteration in a loop or if they are inserted through a parameter,
you should use the Init() method to make sure that the record aligns with the
other data in the table.

The inserted record will automatically get assigned a SystemId by the platform. To
assign a specific SystemId instead of the one assigned by the platform, use
Insert(Boolean, Boolean) instead.

This example shows how to use the Insert method to insert a record with a specified
SystemId.

This method will trigger a JIT load of the specified fields. The method allows for
triggering the JIT load on multiple fields. If the fields are already loaded, another load
will not be triggered. Using this method instead of relying on implicit JIT loads lets you
develop for more explicit error handling when a load fails.

# Record.LockTable([Boolean] [, Boolean])

# Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Starts locking on a table to protect it from write transactions that conflict with each
other.

```
AL
```
_Record_
Type: Record
An instance of the Record data type.

_[Optional] Wait_
Type: Boolean
Specifies what to do if the table is already locked. If this parameter is true and if another
application has already locked the table, the system will wait until the table is unlocked.
If this parameter is false and if another application has already locked the table, a run-
time error occurs.

_[Optional] VersionCheck_
Type: Boolean
If this parameter is true, the version of the Record will be checked. If this parameter is
false, blank, or not used, the version will not be checked.

If the session is not using Read Scale-Out, then LockTable does the following:

1. Starts a transaction.

## Syntax

```
Record.LockTable([Wait: Boolean] [, VersionCheck: Boolean])
```
## Parameters

2. Makes sure that all subsequent statements that read data will apply an UPDLOCK
    on the database.

If the session is using Read Scale-Out, then LockTable does the following:

1. Makes sure that all subsequent statements that read data use REPEATABLEREAD on
    the database.

Because all write operations automatically lock the table that is being used, LockTable
would appear unnecessary. However, you could have a transaction in which an
application wants to inspect data before possibly changing it, with a guarantee that the
data being changed has not been modified by other applications since the read
operation. The solution is to explicitly lock the table before the read operation. This
makes sure that no other application makes changes between the read operation and
the possible write operation.

The table lock is released (unlocked) when the transaction is committed.

This method works the same as the RecordRef LockTable Method.

# Record.Mark([Boolean]) Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Marks a record. You can also use this method to determine whether a record is marked.

```
AL
```
_Record_
Type: Record
An instance of the Record data type.

_[Optional] Mark_
Type: Boolean
Specifies if a record is marked.

_[Optional] Marked_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the record is marked; otherwise, **false**.

The mark on a record is temporary, and disappears when the current session ends. The
Mark method is valid for the specific record instance/variable, and not shared between
all variables of the same record type in a session.

You can use the MarkedOnly (Record) Method to activate a special filter where your view
of the table includes only records marked by the **Mark (Record)** method.

## Syntax

```
[Marked := ] Record.Mark([Mark: Boolean])
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


This example shows how to use the Mark method, assuming that no records are marked
initially. The example loops through the customer records and marks a specific record.
The message dialog displays the records one by one with information about whether
the record is marked or not.

```

```
This next example shows how to use the Mark method together with the MarkedOnly
method, assuming that no records are marked initially.

If no filter is set, the field is modified in all records in the table. If a filter is set, the fields
are modified only in the records which fall within the range specified by the filter.
Records where the field is already equal to the new value are also updated.

The OnValidate field trigger is never run when ModifyAll is used. Using ModifyAll() is
recommended if field validation is not wanted or needed. Otherwise, Record.Modify
Method can be used.

By design, the global variables of the record instance being modified will be
initialized to their default value during the ModifyAll method execution,
independently of the value that was previously set.
```
### Example

// The result of this statement:
customerRec.ModifyAll("Statistics Group", 2 );

# Record.Rename(Any [, Any,...]) Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
_Record_
Type: Record

_[Optional] Value2_
Type: Any

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

Use the Rename method, for example, if you use the customer's telephone number as
the customer number. You can use this method to change the customer number in case
the telephone number changes.

Certain tables you cannot rename, for example:

## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] Record.Rename(Value1: Any [, Value2: Any,...])
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


```
Tables in which the user cannot rename the Document No. field for legal or
business reasons.
Tables in which an Option data type field, such as Document Type , is part of the
primary key.
```
Examples of tables that you cannot rename are:

```
Table 36, Sales Header
Table 38, Purchase Header
Table 5405, Production Order
Table 5766, Warehouse Activity Header
```
If an end-user modifies a record between the time that another end-user or another
process reads the record and modifies it, then the second user must refresh the value of
the record variable before editing the record. Otherwise, the end-user receives the
following run-time error:

```
Another user has modified the record for this <Table Name> after you retrieved it
```
from the database. Enter your changes again in the updated window, or start the

interrupted activity again.

You must design your application so that you use the most up-to-date version of the
record for modifications to the database. You use the Get Method to refresh the record
with the latest version. The second example illustrates this situation.

When a record is renamed, the change is written and committed to the database
without calling the OnModify Trigger. This is done because renaming a record changes
the primary key and updates the primary key value in all related tables. Therefore, you
should use the Rename method and the Record.Modify([Boolean]) Method on a record
separately.

```
AL
```
### Example 1

```
var
CustRec Record Customer
```
```
CustRec.Get( 10000 );
CustRec.Rename( 10001 );
```
### Example 2


This example shows that you get an error if you attempt to rename a record after a
newer version of the record has been written and committed to the database.

In this example, you get a copy of a record from the Customer table and put it into the
CustRec1 variable, then you modify the record. Next, you get a copy of the same record
from the Customer table and put it into the CustRec2 variable. You modify the record

and commit the changes to the database. Now the CustRec1 variable is out of date with

the value in the database. If you were allowed to modify the record using the CustRec1

record, then the changes that you made with CustRec2 would be overwritten by the

values in the CustRec1 variable. It is not allowed to rename a record with the old version
of the record.

```
AL
```
```
The changes to the Customer record cannot be saved because some information on the
```
page is not up-to-date. Close the page, reopen it, and try again. Identification
fields and values: No.='20000'

```
７ Note
```
```
If you do not call the Commit method in this example, then you do not receive an
error.
```
```
var
CustRec1: Record Customer;
CustRec2: Record Customer;
...
CustRec1.LockTable();
CustRec1.Get( 20000 );
CustRec1."Address 2" := 'Suite 102';
CustRec1.Modify();
```
```
CustRec2.Get( 20000 );
CustRec2."Phone No." := '206-555-0109';
CustRec2.Modify();
```
```
Commit();
CustRec1."Phone No." := '425-555-0184';
CustRec1.Rename( 20001 );

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Sets the sort order for the records returned. Use this method after you have set the keys
to sort after, using SETCURRENTKEY. The default sort order is ascending. You can use
SETASCENDING to change the sort order to descending for a specific field, while the
other fields in the specified key are sorted in ascending order.

```
AL
```
_Record_
Type: Record
An instance of the Record data type.

_Field_
Type: Any
The field that you want to set the sort order for.

_Ascending_
Type: Boolean
The sort order. Specify false if data must be sorted in descending order; otherwise true.

SetAscending is applicable to records that aren't displayed in a page in the client. For
example, you can read data from an ODATA web service where data is sorted in
ascending order on one field and descending on another. When the records are shown
in a page, the method has no effect.

## Syntax

```
Record.SetAscending(Field: Any, Ascending: Boolean)
```
## Parameters

## Remarks


The following code example shows how to use SetCurrentKey and SetAscending to sort
data in two different directions based on two fields. It uses SetCurrentKey to specify the
sort based on City and Name. Data will be sorted in ascending order based on those
two fields, first by City, then by Name. Next, you use SetAscending to sort Name in
descending order instead.

```
AL
```
If you publish the page as a web service, and read the OData feed, you'll see the records
sorted in ascending alphabetical order by city and descending alphabetical order by
name. However, if you open the page in the client the city and name are both sorted in
ascending order.

### Example

```
page 50100 MyCustomerList
{
PageType = List;
ApplicationArea = All;
UsageCategory = Lists;
SourceTable = Customer;
layout
{
area(Content)
{
repeater(GroupName)
{
field("City"; City)
{
ApplicationArea = All;
}
field(Name; Name)
{
ApplicationArea = All;
}
}
}
}
```
```
trigger OnOpenPage()
begin
SetCurrentKey(City, Name);
SetAscending(Name, false);
end;
}
```

You can use SetCurrentKey to hint a sort order to the Business Central server. With the

```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


key definitions and adds an ORDER BY clause with the fields from the key to the SQL
statement issued to the database.

When you use SetCurrentKey, the following rules apply:

```
You can't use SetCurrentKey on:
FlowFilter fields
Nested FlowFields
FlowFields on ExternalSQL tables
Blob Fields
FlowFields on Virtual tables
FlowFields that query across app / tenant db
FlowFields that query different table types
```
```
These fields aren't sortable. If any of these fields are used in the method, it returns
false at runtime and an error occurs if not handled.
```
```
Only active keys are considered.
```
```
When the system searches for a key, the first occurrence of a key that starts with
the specified fields is selected, which means:
```
```
Fields that are part of a IncludedFields definition aren't used when searching for
a matching key.
```
```
If you specify only one field as a parameter when you call SetCurrentKey, the
key that is selected might consist of more than one field.
```
```
If the field that you specify is the first component of several keys, the key that is
selected might not be the key that you expect.
```
When writing AL code, you should always assume that calls to **SetCurrentKey** might fail.
Use the following code snippet to write robust AL code that doesn't break if table keys
change.

```
AL
```
### Example - robust coding

```
var
MyRecord: Record MyTable;
begin
if not MyRecord.SetCurrentKey(Field1, Field2) then
// handle if no key was found
```

If a **SetCurrentKey** call fails, an error message is shown to the user:

Suppose that you have the following table with keys defined:

```
AL
```
```
Sorting cannot be done based on the {field1 [, field2]*} field(s) in the
{table name} table.
```
```
Page {page name} has to close.
```
### Example - successful SetCurrentKey call

```
table 50100 MyTable
{
fields
{
field( 1 ; Field1; Integer)
{
}
field( 2 ; Field2; Integer)
{
}
field( 3 ; Field3; Integer)
{
}
field( 4 ; Field4; Integer)
{
}
field( 5 ; Field5; Code[ 10 ])
{
FieldClass = FlowFilter;
}
}
```
```
keys
{
key(Key1; Field1, Field2)
{
}
key(Key2; Field3, Field1, Field2)
{
}
key(Key3; Field1, Field2, Field4)
{
}
```

In AL code, you then use the SetCurrentKey method to imply your preferred sort order
of the data:

```
AL
```
In the previous code example, the Business Central server searches for a key that starts
with the fields **Field1** and **Field2**. For the table **MyTable** , two such keys exist: **Key1** and
**Key3**. It's not deterministic which of the keys the Business Central server uses. For
illustration, assume that the Business Central server picks **Key3**. The SQL statement
generated by the Business Central then looks something like this:

```
SQL
```
In the end, the SQL query optimizer might choose not to use the index corresponding to
**Key3** , if it determines that it can get a faster execution plan without using the index.

```
key(Key4; Field2, Field3)
{
}
}
}
```
```
procedure MyDataProc()
var
MyRecord: Record MyTable;
begin
if not MyRecord.SetCurrentKey(Field1, Field2) then
// handle if no key was found
```
```
if not MyRecord.Find then
// handle no records
// more code here
end;
```
```
SELECT Field1, Field2, Field3, Field4, Field5
FROM MyTable
// this ORDER BY clause is added by the Business Central server due to the
SetCurrentKey call
// assuming that the server picks Key3
ORDER BY Field1, Field2, Field4
```
### Example - unsuccessful SetCurrentKey call

### without a runtime error


Assume that you have the **MyTable** table as defined in the previous example.

The following example illustrates the behavior of SetCurrentKey if no keys can be found.

```
AL
```
In the previous code example, the Business Central server searches for a key that starts
with the field **Field4**. For the table **MyTable** , no such key exists. However, the Business
Central server returns **true** , doesn't raise a runtime error, and still adds an ORDER BY
clause. In this case, the SQL statement generated by the Business Central then looks
something like this:

```
SQL
```
Assume that you have the **MyTable** table as defined in the previous example.

The following example illustrates the behavior of SetCurrentKey if no keys can be found
and the SetCurrentKey uses a field that isn't supported in SetCurrentKey. In this case, the
field has the data type FlowField.

```
AL
```
```
procedure MyDataProcNoKeyFound()
var
MyRecord: Record MyTable;
begin
if not MyRecord.SetCurrentKey(Field4) then
// handle if no key was found
```
```
if not MyRecord.Find then
// handle no records
// more code here
end;
```
```
SELECT Field1, Field2, Field3, Field4, Field5
FROM MyTable
// this ORDER BY clause is added by the Business Central server due to the
SetCurrentKey call
// assuming that the server could not find any key
ORDER BY Field4
```

In the code example, the Business Central server searches for a key that starts with the
field **Field5**. For the table **MyTable** , the field is nonsearchable, so the Business Central
server returns **false**. The Business Central server doesn't add an ORDER BY clause in this
case and raises a runtime error (the error surfaces to the user if it's not handled). In this
case, the SQL statement generated by the Business Central then looks something like
this:

# Record.SetLoadFields([Any,...]) Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 6.0.
```
Sets the fields to be initially loaded when the record is retrieved from its data source.
This will overwrite fields previously selected for initial load.

```
AL
```
_Record_
Type: Record
An instance of the Record data type.

_[Optional] Fields_
Type: Any
The FieldNo's of the fields to be loaded.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if all fields are selected for subsequent loads; otherwise, **false**. If you omit this
optional return value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error
will occur.

Calling SetLoadFields on a record without passing any fields will reset the fields selected
to load to the default, where all readable normal fields are selected for load.

## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] Record.SetLoadFields([Fields: Any,...])
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


It is not necessary to include the following fields, because they are always selected for
loading: Primary key, SystemId, and data audit fields (SystemCreatedAt,
SystemCreatedBy, SystemModifiedAt, SystemModifiedBy).

Depending on the runtime version, the runtime may require extra fields to be selected
for loading. Which extra fields to specify depends on the state of the record and table or
table extension definition. For example, fields that are filtered upon are always loaded.

This method is part of the partial records capability for improving performance. For
more information, see Using Partial Records.

This example uses the SetLoadFields method to speedup the calculation of the mean for
values of the **Standard Cost** field in the **Item** table. Instead of loading all fields, only the
**Standard Cost** is loaded. The other fields aren't needed for the calculation, so they're
not loaded.

key selection, see SetCurrentKey Method.

The following example uses the SetRecFilter method to set a filter on the **Customer**
table, based a key set by the SetCurrentKey method. The GetFilters method) retrieves
the filters and displays them in a message box. Because **Name** is the only field specified
by the SetCurrentKey method, then the first key in the **Customer** table that starts with
the field **Name** is used. In this case, for example, it's a secondary key defined as
key(Key7; Name, Address, City).

The following example opens table number 18 (Customer table) and sets a reference to
the table. The FindLast Method (RecordRef) selects the last record in the table. The
RecordId Method (RecordRef) retrieves the ID of the currently selected record. In this
case, it is the last record in the table. The GetRecord Method (RecordId) uses the

is from the base value of 2000100000. You could use the table number to determine if a
RecordID referred to a temporary table. In Dynamics 365, the table number value of a

named RecRef and finds the first record in the Customers table. If a record is found, the
RecordId Method (RecordRef) gets the ID of the first record in the table. The TableNo
method then uses the RecID variable to retrieve the number of the table that contains
the record. The table number is then displayed in a message box.

The following methods are available on instances of the RecordRef data type.

```
Method name Description
```
```
AddLink(Text [, Text]) Adds a link to a record in a table.
AddLoadFields([Integer,...]) Specifies additional fields to be initially loaded when the record
is retrieved from its data source. Subsequent calls to
AddLoadFields will not overwrite fields already selected for the
initial load.

an error if no table is selected.
```
```
ChangeCompany([Text]) Redirects references to table data from one company to
another.
ClearMarks() Removes all the marks from a record.
```
```
Close() Closes the current page or table.
Copy(var Record [, Boolean]) Copies a specified record's filters, views, automatically
calculated FlowFields, marks, fields, and keys that are associated
with the record from a table or creates a reference to a record.

calculated FlowFields, marks, fields, and keys that are associated
with the record from a table or creates a reference to a record.
CopyLinks(Record) Copies all the links from a particular record.
```
## Instance methods

```
ﾉ Expand table
```

**Method name Description**

CopyLinks(RecordRef) Copies all the links from a particular record.

The current key is returned as a string.

CurrentKeyIndex([Integer]) Gets or sets the current key of the table referred to by the
RecordRef. The current key is set or returned as a number. This
first key = 1, and so on. If RecordRef does not have an active
record, CURRENTKEYINDEX will return -1. If this value is then
passed to KEYINDEX, an index out of bounds error will occur.
Therefore it is important to implement a check of the RecordRef
parameter.

Delete([Boolean]) Deletes a record in a table.

DeleteAll([Boolean]) Deletes all records in a table that fall within a specified range.

DeleteLink(Integer) Deletes a specified link from a record in a table.

DeleteLinks() Deletes all of the links that have been added to a record.

KeyCount() Gets the number of keys that exist in the table that is referred
to by the RecordRef. Returns an error if no table is selected.

KeyIndex(Integer) Gets the KeyRef of the key that has the index specified in the
table that is currently selected. The key can be composed of
fields of any supported data type. Data types that are not
supported include BLOBs, FlowFilters, variables, and functions. If
the sorting key is set to a field that is not part of a key, then the
KEYINDEX is -1.

LoadFields(Integer,...) Accesses the table's corresponding data source and loads the
values of the specified fields on the record.

LockTable([Boolean] [,
Boolean])

```
Starts locking on a table to protect it from write transactions
that conflict with each other.
```
Mark([Boolean]) Marks a record. You can also use this method to determine
whether a record is marked.

MarkedOnly([Boolean]) Activates a special filter. After you use this function, your view
of the table includes only records marked by the Mark method
(RecordRef).

Modify([Boolean]) Modifies a record in a table.

Name() Identifies the name of the table

Next([Integer]) Steps through a specified number of records and retrieves a
record.

Number() Gets the table ID (number) of the table that contains the record
that was referred to by the RecordRef.

Open(Integer [, Boolean] [,
Text])

```
Causes a RecordRef variable to refer to a table, which is
identified by its number in a particular company.

Rename(Any [, Any,...]) Changes the value of a primary key in a table.

Reset() Removes all filters, including any special filters set by the
MarkedOnly method (Record), changes fields select for loading
back to all, and changes the current key to the primary key.
Also removes any marks on the record and clears any AL
variables defined on its table definition.

SecurityFiltering([SecurityFilter]) Gets or sets how security filters are applied to the RecordRef.

SetLoadFields([Integer,...]) Sets the fields to be initially loaded when the record is retrieved
from its data source. This will overwrite fields previously
selected for initial load.

SetPermissionFilter() Applies the user's security filter to the referenced record. The
security filter is combined with any other filters that are placed
on the record with SetFilter or SetRange. The combined filter
will not include any records outside the range of the security
filter and this will prevent a runtime permission error from
occuring when the record is read. If the permission filter is not
set, an error can occur if you attempt to read a record that is
outside the range of the user's security filter.

SetPosition(Text) Sets the fields in a primary key on a record to the values
specified in the String parameter. The remaining fields are not
changed.

SetRecFilter() Sets a filter on a record that is referred to by a RecordRef.

Method name Description
SystemIdNo() Gets the field number that is used by the SystemId field. The
SystemId field is a system field that the platform adds to all
table objects.
SystemModifiedAtNo() Gets the field number that is used by the SystemModifiedAt
field. The SystemModifiedAt field is a system field that the
platform adds to all table objects.
SystemModifiedByNo() Gets the field number that is used by the SystemModifiedBy
field. The SystemModifiedBy field is a system field that the
platform adds to all table objects.
WritePermission() Determines if you can write to a table.
```
The RecordRef object can refer to any table in the database, if the extension target in
app.json doesn't conflict with the field/table scope. Example, an extension with target
Cloud can't use RecordRef to access a table with scope OnPrem. Use the Open method

to use the table number to select the table that you want to access, or use the GetTable
method to use another record variable to select the table that you want to access.

If one RecordRef variable is assigned to another RecordRef variable, then they both refer

to the same table instance.

```
Adds a link to a record in a table.

```
AL
```
_RecordRef_
Type: RecordRef
An instance of the RecordRef data type.

_URL_
Type: Text
The link that you want to add to the record.

_[Optional] Description_
Type: Text
Optional description of the link.

_[Optional] ID_
Type: Integer
The ID of the URL that you want to add to the record. Every time that you add a link to a
page or a table, an entry is created in the Record Link system table. Each entry is given
an ID.

## Syntax

```
[ID := ] RecordRef.AddLink(URL: Text [, Description: Text])
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


The URL can be a link to a Web site, a file stored on the local or on a remote computer,
or a link to a Dynamics 365 page. You can then view the link in the **Links** FactBox on
pages that display the record.

The following example adds a link to a record in the Customer table. The code starts by
opening table 18 (Customer) as a RecordRef variable that is named CustomerRecref. The
Field Method (RecordRef) creates a FieldRef variable that is named MyFieldRef for the
first field (No.). Next, MyFieldRef.Value is set to record 01121212. The Find Method

(RecordRef) method searches the records for record no. 01121212. If the record is found,
then the AddLink method adds a link to the record. The link is assigned a link ID, which
is stored in the LinkID variable. The link ID is displayed in a message box. You can view
the link you added in the **Links** FactBox on the Customer List or Customer Card pages.

Calling SetLoadFields on a record without passing any fields will reset the fields selected
to load to the default, where all readable normal fields are selected for load.

This method is part of the partial records capability for improving performance. For
more information, see Using Partial Records.

This code example uses the AddLoadFields method to make sure that if a record is a
**Currency** , then the **Currency Factor** field is loaded. This code would have to be called
before a database operation is executed on the RecordRef.

This code example shows how you could use the AreFieldsLoaded method to
determines how many fields are currently loaded for a given recordRef. Note that,
because the platform might require more fields be loaded than specified by calls to
SetLoadFields and AddLoadFields, the result might be larger than expected.

RecordRef will be performed.

```
AL
```
_RecordRef_
Type: RecordRef
An instance of the RecordRef data type.

_[Optional] SetAscending_
Type: Boolean
If this parameter is true, it will search in ascending order. If this parameter is false, it will
search in descending order. If you do not specify this parameter, it will check the search
order.

```
## Parameters

## Return Value


This method works just like the Ascending Method (Record).

The following example opens table 18 (Customer) as a RecordRef variable that is named
CustomerRecref. The SetView Method (RecordRef) sets a filter that includes sorting the
data in ascending order. The Ascending method then checks whether the sort order is
ascending, stores the return value in the IsAscending variable and displays **True** in a
message box.

ascending, stores the return value in the IsAscending variable and displays **False** in a
message box because the sort order is descending. The Ascending method changes the
sort order to ascending by setting the _SetAscending_ parameter to **true**. The Ascending
method checks the sort order again. This time **True** is displayed.

Redirects references to table data from one company to another.

```
AL
```
_RecordRef_
Type: RecordRef
An instance of the RecordRef data type.

_[Optional] CompanyName_
Type: Text
The name of the company to which you want to change. If you omit this parameter, you
change back to the current company.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

When executing this method, the user's access rights are respected. For example, a user
cannot access data in _CompanyName_ unless they already have the necessary access
rights.

## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] RecordRef.ChangeCompany([CompanyName: Text])
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


The **ChangeCompany** method is not affected by the Reset Method (RecordRef). You can
deselect a company by making a new call to **ChangeCompany** or by using the Clear
Method.

Global filters always belong to a specific company. If you use the following code to
select the company named NewCompany, any filters assigned to _RecordRef_ will be
transferred to _RecordRef_ in the new company.

```
AL
```
Even if you run the **ChangeCompany** method, triggers still run in the current company,
not in the company that you specified in the **ChangeCompany** method.

This example shows how to use the **ChangeCompany** method. The following code takes
a RecordRef to table **18 Customer** in the current company and redirects it to the table in
another company (in this case Company B). The last record in the Customer table of
Company B is then deleted.

# RecordRef.Count() Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Counts the number of records that are in the filters that are currently applied to the
table referred to by the RecordRef.

```
AL
```
_RecordRef_
Type: RecordRef
An instance of the RecordRef data type.

_Number_
Type: Integer
The number of records in the table.

This method returns the number of records that meet the conditions of any filters
associated with the records. If no filters are set, the method shows the total number of
records in the table.

## Syntax

```
Number := RecordRef.Count()
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked using property access syntax.
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks

```
７ Note
```

In previous versions of Dynamics 365, the Count method ignored security filters and
always returned the total number of records unless you called the SetPermissionFilter
method to get a filtered count.

This method works just like the Count Method (Record).

The following example opens table number 18 (Customer) as a RecordRef that is named
MyRecordRef. The LockTable Method (RecordRef) locks the table. The Count method
then retrieves the number of records in the table. The number of records is stored in the
Count variable. The name of the table and the number of records in the table is
displayed in a message box. The varTableNo variable can be used to open any table and
get the number of records in that table by changing the value of the varTableNo
variable.

```
AL
```
RecordRef Data Type

Developing Extensions

```
The Count method does not lock the table before it retrieves the number of
records in the table. This means that the method reads both uncommitted and
committed data, which could cause the number of records that is returned to be
inaccurate. To make sure that the count is accurate, use the LockTable Method
(RecordRef) before you use the Count method.
```
### Example

```
var
MyRecordRef: RecordRef;
varTableNo: Integer;
Count: Integer;
Text000: Label 'The number of records in the %1 table is: %2.';
begin
varTableNo := 18 ;
MyRecordRef.Open(varTableNo);
MyRecordRef.LockTable;
Count := MyRecordRef.Count;
Message(Text000, MyRecordRef.Name, Count);
end;

Gets or sets the current key of the table referred to by the RecordRef. The current key is
set or returned as a number. This first key = 1, and so on. If RecordRef does not have an
active record, CURRENTKEYINDEX will return -1. If this value is then passed to KEYINDEX,
an index out of bounds error will occur. Therefore it is important to implement a check
of the RecordRef parameter.

# RecordRef.Delete([Boolean]) Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Deletes a record in a table.

```
AL
```
_RecordRef_
Type: RecordRef
An instance of the RecordRef data type.

_[Optional] RunTrigger_
Type: Boolean
Specifies whether the code in the OnDelete trigger will be executed. If this parameter is
true, the code will be executed. If this parameter is false, then the code in the OnDelete
trigger is not executed. The default value is false. This parameter is optional.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

The current key and any filters on the record do not affect this operation. The record to
delete is identified by the values in its primary key.

## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] RecordRef.Delete([RunTrigger: Boolean])
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


If an end-user modifies a record between the time that another end-user or another
process reads the record and modifies it, then the second user must refresh the value of
the record variable before editing the record. Otherwise, the end-user receives the
following run-time error:

**Another user has modified the record for this <Table Name> after you retrieved it
from the database.**

**Enter your changes again in the updated window, or start the interrupted activity
again.**

In earlier versions of Dynamics 365, certain situations allowed code that an end-user
runs to modify a record after a newer version of the record was written and committed
to the database. This would overwrite the newer changes. However, in Dynamics 365
Business Central, we have restricted the Modify Method (RecordRef), Rename Method
(RecordRef), and **Delete** Method (RecordRef) so that the end-user receives the following
run-time error in these certain situations:

**Unable to change an earlier version of the <Table Name> record. The record should
be read from the database again. This is a programming error.**

You must design your application so that you use the most up-to-date version of the
record for modifications to the database. You use the Get Method (RecordRef) to refresh
the record with the latest version.

The following example deletes a record from the Customer table. The code starts by
opening the **Customer** table (18) as a RecordRef variable that is named MyRecordRef.
The Field Method (RecordRef) creates a FieldRef that is named MyFieldRef for field 1,
which is the primary key of the **Customer** table. The Value Method (FieldRef, TestPage
Field) assigns the value 10000 to the field that the MyFieldRef variable refers to. The Find
Method (RecordRef) searches the table for a record with field 1 = 10000. If the record is
found, then it is deleted, the table is modified, and a message is displayed.

```
AL
```
### Example

```
var
varRecordToDelete: Code;
MyRecordRef: RecordRef;
Text000: Label 'Customer %1 is deleted.';
begin
varRecordToDelete := '10000';
MyRecordRef.Open( 18 );
MyFieldRef := MyRecordRef.Field( 1 );

executed. This parameter is optional.

This method works the same way as the DeleteAll Method (Record).

The following example opens table 18 (Customer) as a RecordRef variable that is named
CustomerRecRef. The Field Method (RecordRef) creates a FieldRef variable that is named
MyFieldRef for field 1 (No.). From the No. field, the SetRange Method (FieldRef) selects
records in the range from 10000 to 20000. The number of records in the range is
displayed in a message box. The DeleteALL method deletes all records in that range. The
number of records is displayed again. This time, 0 is displayed because all the records in
the range are deleted.

the record is set to 30000. The Find Method (RecordRef) method.md records for record

30000. If record is found, the Field method retrieves the value in the Name field (field 2),
stores it in the varOldName variable and displays it in a message box. The Value Method
(FieldRef, TestPage Field) changes the value in the Name field to a new name. In this
example, the new name is ‘Contoso’. The table is then modified to reflect this change
and the new value in the Name field is retrieved and displayed in a message box. You
can specify any record in the table and change the value in the Name field.

filtergroup and set a new filtergroup at the same time.

```
AL
```
_RecordRef_
Type: RecordRef

```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked using property access syntax.
```
## Parameters

## Return Value


A filtergroup can contain a filter for a RecordRef that has been set earlier with SetFilter
or SetRange. The total filter applied is the combination of all the filters set in all the
filtergroups.

The following example determines the filtergroup that is set on the Customer table and
then changes filtergroup to 1, which is the filtergroup that is applied globally to the
entire application. The code starts by opening the Customer table with a RecordRef
variable. The SetRecFilter Method (RecordRef) sets the values in the current key of the
current record as a record filter. This filter is a standard filtergroup so it has a filtergroup
number of 0. Then the FilterGroup method returns the number for the filtergroup. This
filtergroup is a standard filter so the return value is 0. This value is stored in the
varOrigGroup variable and displayed in a message box. The FilterGroup method
changes the filtergroup to 1, which is the number for the global filtergroup. The new
value is stored in the varCurrGroup variable and displayed in a message box.

# RecordRef.Find([Text]) Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Finds a record in a table based on the values stored in the key fields.

```
AL
```
_RecordRef_
Type: RecordRef
An instance of the RecordRef data type.

_[Optional] Which_
Type: Text
Specifies how to perform the search. The table will be searched until the record is found
or there are no more records. Each character in the string can be present only one time.
You can use the following characters:

```
=  search for a record that equals the key values (default)
>  search for a record that is larger than the key values
<  search for a record that is less than the key values
+  search for the last record in the table (+ can only be used alone)
-  search for the first record in the table (- can only be used alone) You can
combine the '=', '>', and '<' characters. If this parameter contains '=', '>', or '<',
then you must assign value to all fields of the current and primary keys before you
call FIND.
```
_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean

## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] RecordRef.Find([Which: Text])
```
## Parameters

## Return Value


**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

Find retrieves the first record that meets the conditions set by the _Which_ parameter and
the filters associated with the record. The search path reflects the sort order defined by
the current key. If the current key is not the primary key, there is a chance that several
records might have the same values in current key fields. If this occurs, the sort order
defined by the primary key is used as the search path.

The following example opens table 18 (Customer) as a RecordRef variable named
CustomerRecref. The value for the field 1 (No.) is set to a specified record. In this
example, the field is set to record 40000. The code uses the Find method to find the
record that matches. 40000 in the table. If the record is found, the number, name,
address and city of the customer are displayed in message boxes. The values in the
fields are retrieved by using the Field Method (RecordRef).

```

```
var
CustomerRecref: RecordRef;
MyFieldRef: FieldRef;
varCustomerNo: Code;
Text000: Label 'The customer was found.\\';
Text001: Label 'Customer No. %1 is:\\%2';
Text002: Label 'Sorry, that customer could not be found.';
begin
varCustomerNo := '40000';
CustomerRecref.Open( 18 );
MyFieldRef := CustomerRecref.Field( 1 );
MyFieldRef.Value := varCustomerNo;
if CustomerRecref.Find('=') then begin
Message(Text000 + Text001, CustomerRecref.Field( 1 ),
CustomerRecref.Field( 2 ));
Message('Address: %1, %2', CustomerRecref.Field( 5 ),
CustomerRecref.Field( 7 ));

_RecordRef_
Type: RecordRef

_[Optional] ForUpdate_

parameter to true if you want to modify records in the set. If you set this parameter to
true, then the records will be read with Updlock.

_[Optional] Ok_

**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

You should use this method only when you explicitly want to loop through a recordset.
You should only use this method in combination with repeat..until.

## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] RecordRef.FindSet([ForUpdate: Boolean])
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


The difference between Find() and FindSet is that Find uses paging and the method

only requests N rows in the first request, and then if you need more rows, it'll submit a
new SQL request. The FindSet method will request all rows at once.

The difference between FindSet(false) and FindSet(true) is that FindSet(true) will do
a LockTable() before finding rows, which is an advantage if you plan to update all the

rows you are finding.

This method works the same way as the FindSet Method (Record).

The following example opens table 18 **Customer** as a RecordRef variable that is named
MyRecordRef. The Field Method) creates a FieldRef variable that is named MyFieldRef

with the first field (No.). The SetFilter Method uses the MyFieldRef variable to set a filter
that selects records from 30000 to 32000. MyRecordRef.Field(2) creates a FieldRef for

the second field (Name). The FindSet method finds the set of records based on the key

and the filters that have been set. The _ForUpdate_ parameter is set to **False**. This makes
the records in the set read-only. The record ID and name of each customer in the record
set is displayed in a message box until no records are left in the record set.

with the GetFilters method to retrieve the filters that are applied in the Customer table.
If filters are applied, they will be stored in the Filters1 variable. The Filters1 variable does
not contain any filters because filters have not been set. Then the SetRecFilter Method
(RecordRef) is used to set the value in the current key of the current record as a filter.

The following example is an excerpt from codeunit 8, AccSchedManagement. It iterates
through records in the G/L Account table. It sets some values on the fields of a new
record in the Acc. Schedule Line table based on the current G/L Account record and
inserts the new record into the Acc. Schedule Line table. It calls GetTable to cause a
RecordRef variable to refer to the same table as the new Acc. Schedule Line record, and

## Syntax

```
RecordRef.GetTable(Rec: Record)
```
## Parameters

## Remarks

## Example


then calls the LogInsertion method from codeunit 423, Change Log Management to log
the change. The LogInsertion method requires a RecordRef as a parameter.

This example assumes that the AccSchedLineNo variable has been assigned a value
previously in the code.

The following example opens the Customer table as a RecordRef variable that is named
RecRef. The RecRef variable uses the GetView method to retrieve the field that the table
is sorted on and stores the value in the varView variable. The Customer table does not
have any filters and keys set so no filters or keys are displayed. The _UseCaptions_
parameter is set to **true** so the name of the field is displayed. If you set the _UseCaptions_

assigned based on the data type, as shown in the following table.

After the method runs, you can change the values in any or all of the fields before you
call the Insert Method (RecordRef) to enter the record in the table. Be sure that the fields
that make up the primary key contain values that make the total primary key unique. If
the primary key is not unique (such as the record already exists), then the record is
rejected.

The method works in the same way as the Init Method (Record).

The following example opens a table 18 (Customer) with a RecordRef variable that is
named CustomerRecref. The Field Method (RecordRef) creates a FieldRef variable that is
named MyFieldRef for the field. The Init method initializes the values in the fields by
using default values and then uses the Insert Method (RecordRef) to insert a new record.
The new record is 1120. This is the primary key for the new record.

Records are uniquely identified by the values in primary key fields. The Database
Management System (DBMS) checks the primary key for the table before it inserts a new
record.

If the table contains an auto-increment field, the auto-increment feature is used if the
record contains a zero value in that field. The auto-increment feature enters the new
value into the field as part of the insert.

If the auto-increment field contains a non-zero value, that value is inserted into the table
and the auto-increment feature is not used. If the value in the auto-increment field is

greater than the last auto-increment value in the table, the next auto-increment value
that is entered into the table will be greater than the value in the field that you just
inserted. If the value in the auto-increment field already exists in the table, a run-time
error occurs.

# RecordRef.LockTable([Boolean] [,

Starts locking on a table to protect it from write transactions that conflict with each
other.

```
AL
```
_RecordRef_
Type: RecordRef
An instance of the RecordRef data type.

_[Optional] Wait_
Type: Boolean
Specifies what to do if the table is already locked. If this parameter is true and if another
application has already locked the table, the system will wait until the table is unlocked.
If this parameter is false and if another application has already locked the table, a run-
time error occurs.

_[Optional] VersionCheck_
Type: Boolean
If this parameter is true, the version of the RecordRef will be checked. If this parameter is
false, blank, or not used, the version will not be checked.

If the session is not using Read Scale-Out, then LockTable does the following:

1. Starts a transaction

## Syntax

```
RecordRef.LockTable([Wait: Boolean] [, VersionCheck: Boolean])
```
## Parameters

## Remarks


2. Makes sure that all subsequent statements that read data will apply an UPDLOCK
    on the database.

If the session is using Read Scale-Out, then LockTable does the following:

1. Makes sure that all subsequent statements that read data use REPEATABLEREAD on
    the database.

Because all write operations automatically lock the table that is being used, LockTable
would appear unnecessary. However, you could have a transaction in which an
application wants to inspect data before possibly changing it, with a guarantee that the
data being changed has not been modified by other applications since the read
operation. The solution is to explicitly lock the table before the read operation. This
makes sure that no other application makes changes between the read operation and
the possible write operation.

The table lock is released (unlocked) when the transaction is committed.

This method works the same as the LockTable Method (Record).

The following example opens table number 18 (Customer) as a RecordRef that is named
MyRecordRef. The LockTable method locks the table. This ensures that no records are
inserted or deleted during the counting process. The Count Method (RecordRef) then
retrieves the number of records in the table. The number of records is stored in the
Count variable. The name of the table and the number of records in the table is
displayed in a message box. The varTableNo variable can be used to open any table and
get the number of records in that table by changing the value of the varTableNo
variable.

This example uses pseudo-language to show the scope of write locks. Both an explicit
lock and an automatic lock are illustrated. The first line (1) explicitly locks table A. If this
explicit lock was not set on table A, the Database Management System (DBMS) would
automatically lock this table when a record is inserted (3). Table B is not locked explicitly,
but is locked automatically by the DBMS when a record is inserted (4). Both locks are
active until the system exits the AL code module (5).

If a data update depends on a prior read operation and there is a long time between the
read operation and the write operation, you may not want to lock the table as you
usually would during a transaction. This enables you to prevent other users from
updating the table until your transaction is committed.

If an end-user modifies a record between the time that another end-user or another
process reads the record and modifies it, then the second user must refresh the value of
the record variable before editing the record. Otherwise, the end-user receives the
following run-time error:

**Another user has modified the record for this <Table Name> after you retrieved it
from the database.**

**Enter your changes again in the updated window, or start the interrupted activity
again.**

In earlier versions of Dynamics 365, certain situations allowed code that an end-user
runs to modify a record after a newer version of the record was written and committed
to the database. This would overwrite the newer changes. However, in Dynamics 365
Business Central, we have restricted the **Modify** Method (RecordRef), Rename Method
(RecordRef), and Delete Method (RecordRef) so that the end-user receives the following
run-time error in these certain situations:

**Unable to change an earlier version of the <Table Name> record. The record should
be read from the database again. This is a programming error.**

You must design your application so that you use the most up-to-date version of the
record for modifications to the database. You use the Get Method (RecordRef) to refresh
the record with the latest version.

This method works the same as the Modify Method (Record).

in Steps forward in the table. If this parameter is less than zero, the method will search
the number of records specified in Steps backward in the table. If this parameter is 0, no
records are stepped over. If you do not specify this parameter, the method finds the
next record.

filters and the current key associated with the records. The fields in the record which will
be compared with the current key fields must contain appropriate values before the
method is called.

This method works the same as the Next Method (Record).

The following example opens the Customer table as a RecordRef object, creates a
reference to the first (No.) field, and stores the reference in the MyFieldRef variable. The
SetRange method sets a filter that selects all records from 10000 to 40000 in the No.
field. The Find Method (RecordRef) searches and selects the first record in the filter and
counts the number of records that are found. The number of records is stored in the
Count variable. The process is repeated by looping through all the records in the filter
until no more records are found. The Next method steps through the records and finds
the next record because no value is specified for the _Steps_ parameter. The number of
records that are found in the range is stored in the Count variable and displayed in a
message box.

In versions of Dynamics 365 earlier than Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013, if a RecordRef
referred to a temporary table, then the table number value of the RecordRef was the
run-time generated sequence ID, which is from the base value of 2000100000. You could

contains the ID of the originating physical table and not the run-time generated
sequence ID. If you previously used the Number Method (RecordRef) to test for the
sequence number and determine whether the RecordRef was temporary, then you must
use the IsTemporary Method (RecordRef) in Dynamics 365 instead.

The following example opens the Customer table (18) as a RecordRef object. The Open

# RecordRef.Open(Integer [, Boolean] [,

# Text]) Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Causes a RecordRef variable to refer to a table, which is identified by its number in a
particular company.

```
AL
```
_RecordRef_
Type: RecordRef
An instance of the RecordRef data type.

_No_
Type: Integer
The number of the table.

_[Optional] Temp_
Type: Boolean

_[Optional] CompanyName_
Type: Text
The name of the company to which you want to change. If you omit this parameter, the
current company is used.

When you use the RecordRef.Open method a new object is created. This object contains
references to the open table, filters, and the record itself and all the fields it contains.
You can open a table by using the table number or the name of the table that

## Syntax

```
RecordRef.Open(No: Integer [, Temp: Boolean] [, CompanyName: Text])
```
## Parameters

represents the table number. For example, you open the Customer table by using
following syntax: RecordRef.Open(18) or RecordRef.Open(Database::Customer).
RecordRef.Open(0) is also accepted, whereas passing another non-existent table number

will result in a runtime error message.

If you use the _CompanyName_ parameter, then this method works the same as the
ChangeCompany Method (Record).

The following example uses the Open method to create a RecordRef variable that is
named MyRecordRef for the Customer table. The parameters are omitted in this
example because there is only one company in this example and the table will not be
open as temporary table. The caption and number of records in the table are displayed
in a Message box. At the end of the display, the Close Method (RecordRef) closes the
table.

```
AL
```
This example shows how to use the Open method. In this example, "MyRecordRef"
opens table 27 and then "Find('-')" finds the first record in the table.
"TempMyRecordRef" opens a temporary table which is empty and therefore the "Find('-
')" returns false.

```
AL
```
### Example 1

```
var
MyRecordRef: RecordRef;
Text000: Label 'The %1 table contains %2 records.';
begin
MyRecordRef.Open(Database::Customer);
Message(Text000, MyRecordRef.Caption, MyRecordRef.Count);
MyRecordRef.Close;
end;
```
### Example 2

var
MyRecordRef: RecordRef;
TempMyRecordRef: RecordRef;

MyRecordRef.Open( 27 ,false);
TempMyRecordRef.Open( 27 ,true);

permission. If a filter has been set, the method only tests for read permission in the
range of the filter.

To determine whether the user has a partial read permission because a security filter has
been applied, view the **Permissions** page.

If you do not have permission to read from a table and you attempt to read, a run-time
error occurs. This method lets you determine in advance if you have read permission.
When the permissions are checked, the combination of the permissions in the license
file and the user's permissions in the Permission table is considered.

This method works the same as the ReadPermission Method (Record).

The following example opens table 18 (Customer) and creates a RecordRef variable that
is named MyRecordRef for the table. The ReadPermission method determines whether
the table has read permission and stores the return value in the varHasReadPerm
variable. The Customer table has read permission, so the message displays **Yes**. You can
initialize the varTableNo variable with any table number.

It is not necessary to include the following fields, because they are always selected for
loading: Primary key, SystemId, and data audit fields (SystemCreatedAt,
SystemCreatedBy, SystemModifiedAt, SystemModifiedBy).

This method is part of the partial records capability for improving performance. For
more information, see Using Partial Records.

This code example uses the SetLoadFields method to speedup the calculation of the
mean for values in a table field. The other fields aren't needed for the calculation, so
they're not loaded.

# RecordRef.SetPermissionFilter() Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Applies the user's security filter to the referenced record. The security filter is combined
with any other filters that are placed on the record with SetFilter or SetRange. The
combined filter will not include any records outside the range of the security filter and
this will prevent a runtime permission error from occuring when the record is read. If the
permission filter is not set, an error can occur if you attempt to read a record that is
outside the range of the user's security filter.

a RecordRef variable that is named MyRecordRef. The Field Method (RecordRef) selects
the first field (No.) and stores the value in the MyFieldRef variable. The SetFilter Method
(FieldRef) sets a filter that selects records from 10000 to 20000. The FindLast Method
(RecordRef) finds and retrieves the last record in the record set. The SetPosition method
changes the value in the No. field from 20000 to 20001. The record No. and the name of

permission. If a filter has been set, the method only tests for write permission in the
range of the filter.

To determine whether the user has partial write permission, because a security filter has
been applied, view the **Permissions** page.

If you do not have permission to write to a table and you attempt to write, a run-time
error occurs. This method lets you determine in advance if you have write permission.
When the permissions are checked, the combination of permissions in the license file
and the user's permissions in the Permission table is considered.

This method works the same as the WritePermission Method (Record).

The following example opens table 18 (Customer) and creates a RecordRef variable that
is named MyRecordRef for the table. The WritePermission method determines whether
the table has write permission and stores the return value in the varHasWritePerm
variable. The Customer table has write permission, so the message displays **Yes**. You can
initialize the varTableNo variable with any table number.

```
Gets the default built-in layout type that is used on a specified report.

```
AL
```
_Number_
Type: Integer
The ID of the report that you want to save. If the report that you specify does not exist,
then a run-time error occurs.

_DefaultLayout_
Type: DefaultLayout
The default built-in layout type that is used on a specified report.

The default layout for a report is specified by the report's DefaultLayout Property.

## Syntax

```
DefaultLayout := Report.DefaultLayout(Number: Integer)
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks

## Example (using Report::<object identifier>

## syntax)


As mentioned above, the Report.DefaultLayout method will throw a run-time error if no

report with the supplied object ID exists. If you know the report object, a safe way to call
Report.DefaultLayout is to use the Report::<object identifier> syntax as the compiler

will tell you if Report1 doesn't exist.

```
AL
```
As mentioned above, the Report.DefaultLayout method will throw a run-time error if no
report with the supplied object ID exists. If you don't know the report object in your AL
code, then you can wrap the Report.DefaultLayout method in a Try function as it

doesn't write to the database.

```
AL
```
```
procedure MyProcKnownReport()
var
layout: DefaultLayout;
begin
// When you know the report object, this is safe
// as the compiler will tell you if MyReport does not exist
layout := Report.DefaultLayout(Report::MyReport);
end;
```
### Example (using a Try function)

```
procedure GetLayout(ObjectId: Integer): DefaultLayout
var
layout: DefaultLayout;
begin
if not TryReportDefaultLayout(ObjectId) then begin
// handle error here
end
else // now it's safe to call Report.DefaultLayout
layout := Report.DefaultLayout(ObjectId);
```
```
exit(layout);
end;
```
```
[TryFunction]
// Safe to wrap Report.DefaultLayout in a Try function
// as it doesn't write to the database
procedure TryReportDefaultLayout(ObjectId: Integer)
var
layout: DefaultLayout;
begin
layout := Report.DefaultLayout(ObjectId);
end;

# Report.Execute(Integer, Text [,

# RecordRef]) Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Runs a report in preview or processing-only mode without showing the request page in
the client. The preview document will be downloaded as a PDF file to the user's browser
client, where it can be read with the PDF reader. It won't open the Business Central
preview page in the browser. The method gets the request page parameter values as an
input parameter string from a RunRequestPage method call. The OnOpen and OnClose
triggers on the request page will run even though the request page is not shown.

```
AL
```
_Number_
Type: Integer
The ID of the report that you want to run. If the report that you specify does not exist,
then a run-time error occurs.

_Parameters_
Type: Text
A string of request page parameters as XML to use to run the report. The parameter
string is typically retrieved from the return value a RunRequestPage method call.

_[Optional] RecordRef_
Type: RecordRef
The RecordRef that refers to a record in a table.

## Syntax

```
Report.Execute(Number: Integer, Parameters: Text [, RecordRef: RecordRef])
```
## Parameters

## Remarks


You typically use this method together with the RunRequestPage Method method. The
RunRequestPage Method) runs a report request page without actually running the
report, but instead, it returns the parameters that are set on the request page as a
string. You can then call the Execute method to get the parameter string and run the
report.

For more information, see RunRequestPage Method.

As mentioned above, the Report.Execute method will throw a runtime error if no report

with the supplied object ID exists. If you know the report object, a safe way to call
Report.Execute is to use the Report::<object identifier> syntax as the compiler will tell

you if the report object doesn't exist.

```
AL
```
```

# Report.Print(Integer, Text [, Text] [,

# RecordRef]) Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Prints a specified report without running the request page. Instead of using the request
page to obtain parameters at runtime, the method gets the parameter values as an
input parameter string, typically from a RunRequestPage method call.

```
AL
```
_Number_
Type: Integer
The ID of the report that you want to print. If the report that you specify does not exist,
then a run-time error occurs.

_Parameters_
Type: Text
A string of request page parameters as XML to use to run the report. The parameter
string is typically retrieved from the return value a RunRequestPage method call.

_[Optional] PrinterName_
Type: Text
The name of the printer to use to print the report. The printer must be set up on the
client computer. If you do not set this variable, the printer that is set as the default
printer is used.

_[Optional] RecordRef_
Type: RecordRef
The RecordRef that refers to the table in which you want to find a record.

## Syntax

```
Report.Print(Number: Integer, Parameters: Text [, PrinterName: Text] [,

```
## Parameters


You typically use this method together with the RunRequestPage Method. The
RunRequestPage method runs a report request page without actually running the
report, but instead, it returns the parameters that are set on the request page as a
string. You can then call the Print method to get the parameter string and print the
report.

For a simple example that illustrates how to use the Print method, see example in the
RunRequestPage Method topic.

As mentioned above, the Report.Print method will throw a runtime error if no report

with the supplied object ID exists. If you know the report object, a safe way to call
Report.Print is to use the Report::<object identifier> syntax as the compiler will tell

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Loads and executes the report that you specify.

```
AL
```
_Number_
Type: Integer
The ID of the report that you want to run.

_[Optional] RequestWindow_
Type: Boolean
Specifies whether the request window for the report will be displayed. The request
window is part of the report object.

_[Optional] SystemPrinter_
Type: Boolean
Specifies whether to use the default Windows printer or use table 78, Printer Selection,
to find the correct printer for this report.

_[Optional] Record_
Type: Record
Specifies which record to use in the report. Any filters that are attached to the record
that you specify are used.

## Syntax

```
Report.Run(Number: Integer [, RequestWindow: Boolean] [, SystemPrinter:
Boolean] [, var Record: Record])
```
## Parameters

## Remarks


Use this method, or the Report.RunModal Method, if you don't know the specific report
that you want to run when you're designing your application. If you do know the specific
report that you want to run, then you can use the Run Method or the RunModal
Method.

If the report you specify doesn't exist, then a runtime error occurs.

The parameter SystemPrinter is only used for on-premises scenarios (print on server).

Here, the Business Central server will use the default printer on the server if you use
SystemPrinter = true, otherwise it uses the printer selection.

For the online version of Business Central, users can use printer extension and browser
print.

As mentioned previously, the Report.Run method throws a runtime error if no report

with the supplied object ID exists. If you know the report object, a safe way to call
Report.Run is to use the Report::<object identifier> syntax because the compiler will

tell you if the report object doesn't exist.

```

```
```
７ Note

```
Internet browsers can only handle one file per request. Therefore, with the Web
client, if this method is called in a repetitive statement (or loop) that generates
multiple files, only the last file will be sent to the browser. Alternatively, when
designing for the Web client, bundle the files in an archive file (.zip), for example, by
using the methods found in codeunit 419 File Management. For more details about
this design pattern, see Multi-File Download. The methods in codeunit 419
aren't external, therefore can't be used in extensions. Instead, when developing
extensions in AL, use the external methods of codeunit 425 Data Compression. The
approach is similar.

_Number_
Type: Integer
The ID of the report for which you want to run the request page. If the report that you

_[Optional] Parameters_
Type: Text
A string of request page parameters as XML to use to run the report.

_Parameters_
Type: Text
XML string that contains the request page parameters that are entered on the request
page

This method opens the request page for the specified report to allow the user to
provide parameters for the report. When the user closes the request page by choosing

## Syntax

```
Parameters := Report.RunRequestPage(Number: Integer [, Parameters: Text])
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


the **OK** button, a string that contains the parameter values that were set by the user is
returned. When the user chooses the **Cancel** button, an empty string is returned. The
returned parameter string can be picked up by calling one of the following methods:

```
Execute Method
Print Method
SaveAs Method
```
Because the request page runs in the context of where it was invoked from, users can't
bookmark a link to this page from the user interface.

As mentioned previously, the Report.RunRequestPage method throws a runtime error if

no report with the supplied object ID exists. If you know the report object, a safe way to

the compiler will tell you if the report object doesn't exist.

```
AL
```
This example illustrates how to use the RunRequestPage method to run the request page
for report ID 206 Sales Invoice. The request page parameters are saved to a table. The
parameters are then used with the Execute, SaveAs, and Print methods to preview the
report, save it as a PDF file, and print it.

This example requires that you create a table for holding parameters that are entered on
the report request page and a codeunit that runs the report methods.

Create a table called **ReportParameters** that has the following fields.

# Report.SaveAs(Integer, Text,

# ReportFormat, var OutStream [,

# RecordRef]) Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Runs a specific report without a request page and saves the report as a PDF, Excel,
Word, HTML, or XML file. Instead of using the request page to obtain parameters at
runtime, the method gets the parameter values as an input parameter string, typically
from the return value of a RunRequestPage method call.

```
AL
```
_Number_
Type: Integer
The ID of the report that you want to save. If the report that you specify does not exist,
then a run-time error occurs.

_Parameters_
Type: Text
A string of request page parameters as XML to use to run the report. The parameter
string is retrieved from the return value a RunRequestPage method call.

_Format_
Type: ReportFormat
The type of file to save the report as. The following options are supported: Pdf, Excel,
Word, and XML.

_OutStream_
Type: OutStream

## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] Report.SaveAs(Number: Integer, Parameters: Text, Format:
ReportFormat, var OutStream: OutStream [, RecordRef: RecordRef])
```
## Parameters


The stream to which to write a report.

_[Optional] RecordRef_
Type: RecordRef
The RecordRef that refers to the table in which you want to find a record.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

You typically use this method together with the RunRequestPage Method method. The
RunRequestPage method runs a report request page without actually running the report,

but instead, it returns the parameters that are set on the request page as a string. You
can then call the SaveAs method to get the parameter string and save the report to a
file of the specified format.

For a simple example that illustrates how to use the SaveAs method, see the example in

the RunRequestPage Method method article.

The method can fail in the following two ways:

```
If no report exists with an object id as specified in " Number ".
If the string of request page parameters as XML specified in " Parameters " can't be
parsed as valid request page data.
```
### Return Value

### Remarks

```
７ Note
```
```
By default, when a report uses an RDL report layout at runtime, fonts are
embedded in the generated PDF. You can specify whether fonts are embedded in
the PDF for RDL reports by changing the Report PDF Font Embedding setting in
the Dynamics 365 Business Central service instance configuration or changing the
PDFFontEmbedding property in report objects.

# Report.SaveAsExcel(Integer, Text [, var

# Record]) Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Saves a report on the computer that is running the server as a Microsoft Excel (.xls)
workbook.

```
AL
```
_Number_
Type: Integer
The ID of the report that you want to run. If the report you specify does not exist, then a
run-time error occurs.

_FileName_
Type: Text
The path and the name of the file that you want to save the report as. The path must
exist, the file must not be used, and the server process must have permission to write to
the file. Otherwise, you will get errors.

_[Optional] Record_
Type: Record
Specifies which record to use in the report. Any filters that have been applied to the
record that you specify will be used.

```
７ Note
```
```
This method is supported only in Business Central on-premises.
```
## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] Report.SaveAsExcel(Number: Integer, FileName: Text [, var Record:
Record])
```
## Parameters


_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

You can use the SaveAsExcel method on the global Report object and on instances of a
Report variable. If, at design time, you do not know the specific report that you want to
run, then use this method (the static one) and specify the report object ID in the _Number_
parameter. If you do know which report you want to run, then use the instance method
Report.SaveAsExcel(FileName: Text).

When you call the SaveAsExcel method, the report with object ID specified in " _Number_ "
is generated and saved to the file specified in " _FileName_ ." The request page is not
shown.

The method can fail in the following four ways:

```
If no report exists with an object id as specified in " Number ".
If the destination folder specified in FileName does not exist,
If the file specified in FileName is being used, or
If the Business Central server process does not have permission to write to the file
specified in FileName.
```
If the report you specify does not exist, then a run-time error occurs.

If the destination folder that you specify in _FileName_ does not exist, then you get the
following error: **The specified path is invalid.**

### Return Value

### Remarks

```
７ Note
```
```
The FileName parameter specifies a location on the computer that is running
Business Central. If you call this method from a client, such as from an action on a
page, then use the File.Download method to download the .pdf file from the
computer that is running the Business Central server to the computer that is
running the client.

# Report.SaveAsHtml(Integer, Text [, var

# Record]) Method

Article•10/07/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Saves a report as an HTML file. The file is saved on the computer where the server
instance is running, and then downloaded to the client when ready. This method is only
supported when a report uses a Word report layout when it is run.

```
AL
```
_Number_
Type: Integer
The ID of the report object that you want to run.

_FileName_
Type: Text
The folder path and name of the file that you want to save the report as. The path must
already exist and the service (login) account that is used by the server instance must
have permission to write to the target folder. Otherwise, you will get errors.

_[Optional] Record_
Type: Record
Specifies which record to use in the report. Any filters that have been applied to the
record that you specify will be used.

```
７ Note
```
```
This method is supported only in Business Central on-premises.
```
## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] Report.SaveAsHtml(Number: Integer, FileName: Text [, var Record:
Record])
```
## Parameters


_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

You can use the SaveAsHTML method on the global Report object and on instances of a
Report variable. If, at design time, you do not know the specific report that you want to
run, then use this method (the static one) and specify the report object ID in the _Number_
parameter. If you do know which report you want to run, then use the instance method
Report.SaveAsHTML(FileName: Text).

When you call the SaveAsHtml method, the report is generated and saved to the file
specified in " _FileName_ ." The request page is not shown.

Prior to version 23.0, the SaveAsHTML method uses the logic in the codeunit **9651
Document Report Mgt.** code unit to handle the format transformation. From version
23.0, the platform handles everything.

The method can fail in the following five ways:

```
If no report exists with an object id as specified in " Number ".
If the default layout of the report is not of type Word,
If the destination folder specified in FileName does not exist,
If the file specified in FileName is being used, or
If the Business Central server process does not have permission to write to the file
specified in FileName.
```
### Return Value

### Remarks

```
７ Note
```
```
The FileName parameter specifies a location on the computer that is running
Business Central. If you call this method from a client, such as from an action on a
page, then use the File.Download method to download the .pdf file from the
computer that is running the Business Central server to the computer that is
running the client.
```
###### Error conditions


If the report you specify does not exist, then a run-time error occurs.

Reports that use an RDLC or Excel layout when run cannot be saved in the HTML format.
A runtime error will occur if SaveAsHTML is used on such a report layout.

If the destination folder that you specify in _FileName_ does not exist, then you get the
following error: **The specified path is invalid.**

If the file that you specify in _FileName_ is being used, then you get the following error:
**An I/O exception occurred during the operation.**

If the Business Central server process does not have permission to write to the file that
you specify in _FileName_ , then you get the following error: **Either the caller does not
have the required permission or the specified path is read-only.**

This example shows how to use the static version of SaveAsHtml method in a safe way
(where no errors occur).

_InStream_
Type: InStream
The variable in which to return the Word report layout.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] Report.WordLayout(Number: Integer, InStream: InStream)
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


Using the return value is optional. When you use the return value, if the Word report
layout can't be retrieved at runtime, then the system returns **false** and no error is
recorded. When you omit the return value, if the Word report layout can't be retrieved
at runtime, then an error occurs, which states that the Word report couldn't be retrieved.

The Report.WordLayout method will throw a runtime error if the operation fails, either if

no object exists with that object ID or if no Word layout exists for that report. This code
example shows how to write robust AL code to handle possible failures.

```
AL
```
If the report is known when you write the code, the safest way to avoid runtime errors is
to use the scope (::) operator to reference the report object. This way you'll get a
compile time error if the report doesn't exist. The example illustrates how to call
WordLayout on the report MyReport using this technique:

```
AL
```
### Example

```
var
layoutAsStream: InStream;
result: Boolean;
begin
result := Report.WordLayout(ObjectId, layoutAsStream);
if result then
// use the layout that now is available in the stream
else
// handle that no object exists with that id or that no Excel layout
exists for that report
;
end;
```
```
var
layoutAsStream: InStream;
result: Boolean;
begin
// if MyReport does not exist, then Report::MyReport will fail at
compile time
result := Report.WordLayout(Report::MyReport, layoutAsStream);
```
```
if result then
// use the layout that now is available in the stream
else
// handle that no Excel layout exists for that report
;
end;

## Report.WordXmlPart(Integer [, Boolean])

## Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Returns the report data structure as structured XML that is compatible with Microsoft Word custom
XML parts. The method has an instance call and a static call. The following code shows the syntax of
the WORDXMLPART function. The first line of code is the syntax for an instance method call. The
second line of code is the syntax for a static method call.

```
AL
```
_Number_
Type: Integer
The ID of the report that you want to run. If the report you specify does not exist, then a run-time error
occurs.

_[Optional] ExtendedFormat_
Type: Boolean
If you set this variable to true, then XML elements will include the following attributes:

```
ElementType="Parameter|Column|DataItem". Specifies the element type as defined for the report
in Report Designer. Parameter is typically used for elements, such as captions.
ElementId="ID". Specifies the ID that is assigned to the element by its ID Property.
DataType="Type". Specifies the data type of the element. If you omit this parameter or set it to
false, then the element attributes are not included in the XML. This is the recommended setting
when you will use the Word XML part in Word for modifying the report layout because the XML is
simpler. The following example illustrates an XML element that has the ExtendedFormat set to
true: <CompanyName ElementType="Column" ElementId="3" DataType="OemText"> The
following example illustrates the same XML with the ExtendedFormat set to false:
<CompanyName>
```
_String_
Type: Text

##### Syntax

```
String := Report.WordXmlPart(Number: Integer [, ExtendedFormat: Boolean])
```
##### Parameters

##### Return Value

columns that have the IncludeCaption Property set to Yes
and labels that are defined in the labels section of the
report.
```
- Label elements that are related to columns have the
format
    <ColumnNameCaption>ColumnNameCaption</ColumnNameCaption>,
where ColumnName is determined by the column's Name
Property.
- Label elements from the labels section of the report have
the format <LabelName>LabelCaption</LableName, where
    LabelName is determined by the label's Name Property and
    LabelCaption is determined by the label's Caption Property.
..<DataItem1>
....
<DataItem1Column1>DataItem1Column1</DataItem1Column1>

```
Top-level data item and columns. Columns are listed in
alphabetical order.
The element names and values are determined by the Name
property of the data item or column.

Word custom XML parts enable you to integrate business data into Word documents. For example, the
WordXMLPart method is used internally by Business Central when you are creating report layouts in
Word. You can use this method to create a custom XML part, and then, together with the SaveAsXML
Method (Reports) method and additional data merging tools, you can implement your own
functionality for mapping and laying out report data in Word documents. To create a custom XML part,
you can save the return value to an .xml file that is encoded in UTF-16 (16-bit Unicode Transformation
Format). The resultant file can be added to Word documents as a custom XML part to map the report
data set as XML data.

The following example uses the WordXMLPart method to save the data structure of the report
MyReport into a Text variable. The resultant string can be used in Word as a custom XML part.

```
AL
```
```
AL
```
##### Example

```
report 50142 MyReport
{
dataset
{
dataitem(MyDataitem; MyTable)
{
column(Field1; MyField)
{
}
}
dataitem(MySecondDataitem; MyTable42)
{
column(Field42; MyField42)
{
}
}
}
labels
{
MyLabel = 'My Label Text';
MySecondLabel = 'My Second Label Text';
}
...
}
```
```
var
ReportAsXmlString: Text;
begin
```

</MyDataitem>
<MySecondDataitem>
<Field42>Field42</Field42>
</MySecondDataitem>
</NavWordReportXmlPart>
```
```
７ Note
The first parameter in WordXmlPart is an integer which represents the object ID of the report. To
code robustly, never supply the object ID directly in your code. Instead, use the :: operator as
illustrated in the example above. With this technique, if the report does not exist, you'll get a
compile time error instead of a runtime error.

# Report.Break() Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Exits from a loop or a trigger in a data item trigger of a report or XmlPort.

```
AL
```
_Report_
Type: Report
An instance of the Report data type.

BREAK causes the current trigger to end. When used inside a loop, such as a WHILE-DO
or REPEAT-UNTIL construction, BREAK interrupts the loop and causes the current trigger
to end.

Compare this with the QUIT Method (Report, XMLport).

## Syntax

```
Report.Break()
```
## Parameters

## Remarks

```
７ Note
```
```
BREAK still calls remaining triggers for the current record, but the record is omitted
from the dataset.
```
```
 Tip
```
```
You can also use the AL BREAK Statement to exit an iteration or loop. The
difference is that the BREAK statement does not terminate the trigger. It just exits
the loop.

CreateTOTALS maintains group and grand totals. The totals can be printed by placing
controls that have the variable or variables that are the arguments of CreateTOTALS as
their source expressions in the appropriate sections. The group totals are printed in
GroupFooter sections, and the grand totals are printed in Footer sections.

This method is not supported on client report definition (RDLC) report layouts. In most
cases, when you create a layout suggestion for a Classic report layout that uses the
CreateTOTALS method, a SUM expression is created instead and no action is required.

will be aligned with the language in the current report run and that the report does not
have native support for format region. The document is printed in the language that is
specified in the **Language Code** field on the **Customer Card** page.

In reports that need the multiple document format functionality, you can insert the

_Report_
Type: Report
An instance of the Report data type.

_[Optional] Language_
Type: Integer
The new language setting for the report.

_[Optional] CurrentLanguage_
Type: Integer
The current language setting for the report.

The Language integer parameter must point to a valid Windows Language Code

Identifier (LCID). For more information, see Windows Language Code Identifier (LCID)

## Syntax

```
[CurrentLanguage := ] Report.Language([Language: Integer])
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked using property access syntax.
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


Reference. The Language codeunit includes the GetLanguageId method that can safely

return a valid LCID from a language code in the Language table. If you call

```
Report.Language with an invalid LCID, then a runtime error occurs.
```
If you have reports that you want to print in the language of the recipient rather than in
your own working language, you can add a single line of code in the report to handle
this. This functionality is already enabled for most reports in the standard Business
Central database. The document is printed in the language that's specified in the
**Language Code** field on the **Customer Card** page.

For reports that need the multiple document languages functionality, you must insert
the following AL code as the first line in the OnAfterGetRecord() trigger on the data item

referencing the **Customer** table (notice that the feature isn't limited to the **Customer**
table, other data sources provide similar functionality):

```
CurrReport.Language := LanguageMgmt.GetLanguageIdOrDefault("Language Code");
```
For each of these reports, you must create a new variable, LanguageMgmt, with the data
type Codeunit pointing to the Language codeunit. When you have compiled the object,

it'll no longer print in the user's working application language if another language has
been specified on the **Customer Card** page.

The following example illustrates how to use the Language codeunit to set the language
defined on the customer card in a report. The example is based on report 10071
"Customer Stmt. (Pre-Printed)" from the base application.

```
AL
```
### Example

```
report 10071 "Customer Stmt. (Pre-Printed)"

dataitem(Customer; Customer)

```
_Report_
Type: Report
An instance of the Report data type.

After you define the _Report_ variable, you can run this method or the RunModal Method
(Report) on the variable. With the Run method, the variable is automatically cleared after

the method is run. With the RunModal method, the variable isn't automatically cleared.

Use the Run method or the RunModal method if you know at design time the exact

report that you want to run. Otherwise, use the static methods Report.Run Method or
Report.RunModal Method.

Internet browsers can only handle one file per request. Therefore, with the Web
client, if this method is called in a repetitive statement (or loop) that generates
multiple files, only the last file will be sent to the browser. Alternatively, when
designing for the Web client, bundle the files in an archive file (.zip), for example, by
using the methods found in codeunit 419 File Management. For more details about
this design pattern, see Multi-File Download. The methods in codeunit 419
aren't external, therefore can't be used in extensions. Instead, when developing

# Report.RunRequestPage([Text]) Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Runs the request page for a report without running the report. Returns an XML string
that contains the request page parameters that are entered on the request page.

```
AL
```
_Report_
Type: Report
An instance of the Report data type.

_[Optional] PageParameters_
Type: Text
A string of request page parameters as XML to use to run the report.

_ReportParameters_
Type: Text
XML string that contains the request page parameters that are entered on the request
page

This method opens the request page for the specified report, where the user can
provide parameters for the report. When the user closes the request page by choosing
the **OK** button, a string that contains the parameter values that were set by the user is
returned. When the user chooses the **Cancel** button, an empty string will be returned.

## Syntax

```
ReportParameters := Report.RunRequestPage([PageParameters: Text])
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


The returned parameter string can be picked up by calling one of the following
methods:

```
Execute Method
Print Method
SaveAs Method
```
Because the request page runs in the context of where it was invoked from, users cannot
bookmark a link to this page from the user interface.

This example illustrates how to use the RunRequestPage method to run the request
page for report ID 206 Sales Invoice. The request page parameters are saved to a table,
and then uses the parameters with the Execute, SaveAs, and Print methods to preview
the report, save it as a PDF file, and print it.

This example requires that you create a table for holding parameters that are entered on
the report request page and a codeunit that runs the report methods.

Create a table called **Request Parameters** that has the following fields.

```
AL
```
Create a codeunit and add the following code to the _OnRun_ trigger of the codeunit.

```
AL
```
```
７ Note

### Example

```

ReportId: Integer;
UserId: Code[ 100 ];
Parameters: BLOB;
```
```
var
ReportParameters: Record "Report Parameters";
XmlParameters: Text;
OStream: OutStream;

# Report.SaveAs(Text, ReportFormat, var

# OutStream [, RecordRef]) Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Runs a specific report without a request page and saves the report as a PDF, Excel,
Word, or XML file. Instead of using the request page to obtain parameters at runtime,
the method gets the parameter values as an input parameter string, typically from the
return value of a RunRequestPage method call.

```
AL
```
_Report_
Type: Report
An instance of the Report data type.

_Parameters_
Type: Text
A string of request page parameters as XML to use to run the report. The parameter
string is retrieved from the return value a RunRequestPage method call.

_Format_
Type: ReportFormat
The type of file to save the report as. The following options are supported: Pdf, Excel,
Word, and XML.

_OutStream_
Type: OutStream
The stream to which to write a report.

## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] Report.SaveAs(Parameters: Text, Format: ReportFormat, var
OutStream: OutStream [, RecordRef: RecordRef])
```
## Parameters


_[Optional] RecordRef_
Type: RecordRef
The RecordRef that refers to the table in which you want to find a record.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

You typically use this method together with the RunRequestPage Method method. The
RunRequestPage method runs a report request page without actually running the report,

but instead, it returns the parameters that are set on the request page as a string. You
can then call the SaveAs method to get the parameter string and save the report to a
file of the specified format.

For a simple example that illustrates how to use the SaveAs method, see the example in

the RunRequestPage Method method topic.

The method can fail in the following ways:

```
If the string of request page parameters as XML specified in " Parameters " can't be
parsed as valid request page data.
```
### Return Value

### Remarks

```
７ Note
```
```
By default, when a report uses an RDL report layout at runtime, fonts are
embedded in the generated PDF. You can specify whether fonts are embedded in
the PDF for RDL reports by changing the Report PDF Font Embedding setting in
the Dynamics 365 Business Central service instance configuration or changing the
PDFFontEmbedding property in report objects.

Saves a report on the computer that is running the server as a Microsoft Excel (.xls)
workbook.

```
AL
```
_Report_
Type: Report
An instance of the Report data type.

_FileName_
Type: Text
The path and the name of the file that you want to save the report as. The path must
exist, the file must not be being used, and the server process must have permission to
write to the file. Otherwise, you will get errors.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

```
７ Note
```
```
This method is supported only in Business Central on-premises.
```
## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] Report.SaveAsExcel(FileName: Text)
```
## Parameters

## Return Value


You can use the SaveAsExcel method on the global Report object and on instances of a
Report variable. If, at design time, you do not know the specific report that you want to
run, then use the static version of the method: Report.SaveAsExcel(Integer, Text [, var
Record]).

When you call the SaveAsExcel method, the report is generated and saved to the file
specified in " _FileName_ ." The request page is not shown.

The method can fail in the following three ways:

```
If the destination folder specified in FileName does not exist,
If the file specified in FileName is being used, or
If the Business Central server process does not have permission to write to the file
specified in FileName.
```
If the destination folder that you specify in _FileName_ does not exist, then you get the
following error: **The specified path is invalid.**

If the file that you specify in _FileName_ is being used, then you get the following error:
**An I/O exception occurred during the operation.**

If the Business Central server process does not have permission to write to the file that
you specify in _FileName_ , then you get the following error: **Either the caller does not
have the required permission or the specified path is read-only.**

This example shows how to use the SaveAsExcel method to generate the report in the
Business Central server and then download the Excel workbook file to the server.

### Remarks

```
７ Note

# Report.SaveAsHtml(Text) Method

Article•10/07/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Saves a report as an HTML file. The file is saved on the computer where the server
instance is running, and then downloaded to the client when ready. This method is only
supported when a report uses a Word report layout when it is run.

```
AL
```
_Report_
Type: Report
An instance of the Report data type.

_FileName_
Type: Text
The folder path and name of the file that you want to save the report as. The path must
already exist and the service (login) account that is used by the server instance must
have permission to write to the target folder. Otherwise, you will get errors.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

```
７ Note
```
```
This method is supported only in Business Central on-premises.
```
## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] Report.SaveAsHtml(FileName: Text)
```
## Parameters

## Return Value


The SaveAsHTML method can be used on the Report data type and on Report variables.
When you are programming the SaveAsHTML method, if you do not know the specific
report that you want to run, then use the static version of the SaveAsHTML method, see
Report.SaveAsHtml(Integer, Text [, var Record]).

When you call the SaveAsHTML method, the report is generated and saved to the file
specified in " _FileName_ ." The request page is not shown.

Prior to version 23.0, the SaveAsHTML method uses the logic in the codeunit **9651
Document Report Mgt.** code unit to handle the format transformation. From version
23.0, the platform handles everything.

The method can fail in the following four ways:

```
If the default layout of the report is not of type Word,
If the destination folder specified in FileName does not exist,
If the file specified in FileName is being used, or
If the Business Central server process does not have permission to write to the file
specified in FileName.
```
Reports that use an RDLC or Excel layout when run cannot be saved in the HTML format.
A runtime error will occur if SaveAsHTML is used on such a report layout.

If the destination folder that you specify in _FileName_ does not exist, then you get the
following error: **The specified path is invalid.**

If the file that you specify in _FileName_ is being used, then you get the following error:
**An I/O exception occurred during the operation.**

### Remarks

SETTableView is not supported for setting views on subpages from code on table
headers. For example, you cannot set a table view on the SalesOrder subpage from
the SalesHeader.
```
### Example

```
var
SalesHeader: Record "Sales Header";
SomePage: Page "Sales List";
begin
SalesHeader.SETCURRENTKey("Document Type");
SalesHeader.SETRANGE("Document Type",SalesHeader."Document
Type"::Order);
SomePage.SETTableView(SalesHeader); // Only view sales orders.

# Report.Skip() Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Skips the current iteration of the current report or XmlPort.

```
AL
```
_Report_
Type: Report
An instance of the Report data type.

The Skip method allows you to conditionally skip processing of the current report or
XMLport. If the processing occurs inside a loop, the processing continues with the next
record after the Skip method is called.

A typical situation in which you will use SKIP is when you want to retrieve records from a
related table by using values in the current record for forming a filter. If the values in the
current record already indicate that no records from the related table will be retrieved,
there is no need to perform this processing and you can use SKIP to avoid the
processing.

## Syntax

```
Report.Skip()
```
## Parameters

## Remarks

```
７ Note
```
```
The Skip method still calls remaining triggers for the current record, but the record
is omitted from the dataset.
```
## Example

Word custom XML parts enable you to integrate business data into Word documents. For example, the
WordXMLPart method is used internally by Business Central when you are creating report layouts in
Word. You can use this method to create a custom XML part, and then, together with the SaveAsXML
Method (Reports) method and additional data merging tools, you can implement your own
functionality for mapping and laying out report data in Word documents. To create a custom XML part,

```
ﾉ Expand table
```

you can save the return value to an .xml file that is encoded in UTF-16 (16-bit Unicode Transformation
Format). The resultant file can be added to Word documents as a custom XML part to map the report
data set as XML data.

The following example uses the WordXMLPart method to save the data structure of the report
MyReport into a Text variable. The resultant string can be used in Word as a custom XML part.

```
AL
```
```
AL
```
The resulting XML then looks like this

```
XML
```
##### Example

```
report 50142 MyReport
{
dataset
{
dataitem(MyDataitem; MyTable)
{
column(Field1; MyField)
{
}
}
dataitem(MySecondDataitem; MyTable42)
{
column(Field42; MyField42)
{
}
}
}
labels
{
MyLabel = 'My Label Text';
MySecondLabel = 'My Second Label Text';
}
...
}
```
```
var
ReportAsXmlString: Text;
MyReport: Report Report6;
begin
ReportAsXmlString := MyReport.WordXmlPart();
end;
```
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>
<NavWordReportXmlPart xmlns="urn:microsoft-dynamics-nav/reports/MyReport/50142">

You can only call this method on codeunits that have the EventSubscriberInstance
Property set to **Manual**.

The codeunit instance that event subscribers are bound to will be this exact instance.
Events will be raised on this instance. You can't bind the same instance more than once,
but you can bind multiple instances of the same codeunit. This condition will result in an
event subscriber call on each bound instance when a given event is raised.

The following sample code illustrates a typical use of the BindSubscription method.

```
AL
```
Session Data Type
Get Started with AL

### Example

```
procedure MyFunction()
var
Subscriber: Codeunit Subscriber;
begin
// Set global information on the subscriber codeunit if required
// You can rely on the instance being the same as the one receiving the
event subscriber call
Subscriber.MySetGlobalInfo( 123 ); //info you can later test in the
subscriber event method
BindSubscription(Subscriber);
DoSomething(); // After binding, all subscriptions on Subscriber are
"active".
end; // Notice, that when Subscriber goes out of scope, all bindings are
removed.

# Session.StartSession(var Integer, Integer

# [, Text] [, var Record]) Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Starts a session without a UI and runs the specified codeunit.

```
AL
```
_SessionId_
Type: Integer
The ID of the new session that is started. The ID is assigned to the SessionID variable
after the session is started successfully. This parameter is passed by reference to the
method.

_CodeunitId_
Type: Integer
The ID of the codeunit to run when the session is started.

_[Optional] Company_
Type: Text
The company in which to start the session. By default, the session is started in the same
company as the calling session.

_[Optional] Record_
Type: Record

## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] Session.StartSession(var SessionId: Integer, CodeunitId: Integer
[, Company: Text] [, var Record: Record])
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
```
## Parameters


A record that is passed to the OnRun trigger of the codeunit that runs when the session
is started. This parameter is optional.

_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

The session is started on the same Business Central instance from which the method is
called. The session that is started is a background session and therefore has no UI. The
session executes using the same user credentials as the calling AL code.

Each background session has the same impact on resources as a regular user session. In
addition, it takes time and resources to start each background session. Therefore, we
recommend that you consider when and how you use background sessions. For
example, do not use background sessions for small tasks that occur often because the
cost of starting the session for each tasks is high.

The following table describes how dialog boxes are handled in a background or web
service session, which has no UI.

```
Method that creates
the dialog box
```
```
Behavior
```
```
Dialog.Confirm - Dialog box is suppressed.
```
- The following error occurs on the Business Central instance: **Business
Central attempted to issue a client callback to show a confirmation
dialog box.**
Dialog.Error - Dialog box is suppressed.
- AL code execution ends.
- The error is logged to the event log of the Business Central instance.
- The error is added to the **Comments** field of the **Session Event** table.

## Parameters

## Return Value


_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

The session that you want to stop and the session that calls StopSession must be
running on the same instance of Dynamics 365 Business Central service. The session is
stopped before the next AL statement executes. Open transactions are rolled back.

When a session is executing AL that does not interact with the server connection or the
access lock used by the connection, StopSession cannot terminate the connection.
StopSession can terminate connections that are inactive, idle, or using the database but
not blocked.

You cannot stop the current, active session in which you are executing the **StopSession**
call.

This example assumes that you have a table named CacheStressTest that you use for
testing.

```

You can only call this method on codeunits that have the EventSubscriberInstance
Property set to **Manual**.

Calling this method on a codeunit that hasn't been bound (by the BindSubscription
Method) will result in an error. If the call to this method is successful, all bindings are
removed.

The codeunit instance that is unbound will be the same instance that previously was
bound.

The Init method is useful before calling the RequestSessionUpdate method to ensure
that all properties are initialized before sending the request to the server instance to
start a new client session.

This example uses the Init method to create a SessionSettings object that includes the
current client user's personalization settings from the database, and uses the Company
method to set the company to 'MyCompany'. Then, the RequestSessionUpdate method
sends a request to the client to abandon the current client session and start a new
session that uses the personalization settings in the SessionSettings object.

A profile can be included as part of an extension, instead of being defined as part of the
base application. In order to properly identify a profile from an extension in the
SessionSettings object, you must specify the extension ID, by using the ProfileAppId
method, and the profile ID, by using ProfileId method.

The ProfileAppId property in a SessionSettings object corresponds to the **App ID** field in
the in the system table **2000000073 User Personalization**

This example creates a SessionSettings object that is populated with the current client
user's personalization data, and then uses the ProfileAppId method and ProfileId
method to set the object to use the profile that has the ID 'MyExtensionProfile', which is
provided in the extension that has the ID 'aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb'.
Finally, the RequestSessionUpdate method sends a request to the client to abandon the
current client session and start a new session that uses the new profile. This example
requires a SessionSettings data type variable.

The profile ID determines the Role Center that is used in the client session. The ProfileId
property in a SessionSettings object corresponds to the **Profile ID** field in the in the
system table **2000000073 User Personalization**.

This example creates a SessionSettings object that is populated with the current client
user's personalization data, and uses the changes the Profile method to set the profile
to 'Business Manager'. Finally, the RequestSessionUpdate method sends a request to the
client to abandon the current session and start a new session that uses the new profile
ID. This example requires a SessionSettings data type variable.

# SessionSettings.RequestSessionUpdate(

# Boolean) Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.

Type: Boolean
Specifies whether to save the personalization properties in the SessionSettings object to
the table **2000000073 User Personalization** in the database for the current client user.
**true** saves the settings; **false** does not. If you set this parameter to **true** , before sending
the request to the client, the server instance will store the property values of the
SessionSettings object to the corresponding fields in the table **2000000073 User
Personalization**. If you set this to **false** , when the new client session is closed, the next
time the user signs in, the session will return to the previous personalization settings.
This enables you to use the SessionSettings object to temporarily change the
personalization settings for the current session.

Within the scope of the RequestSessionUpdate method, it is not recommended to run
code after the RequestSessionUpdate method call that requires client communication
because the current client session will be abandoned.

Before the RequestSessionUpdate method is called, be sure that all user personalization
properties in the SessionSettings object have values; otherwise the system default values
will be used for empty properties. To help, you can use the Init method to populate the
object with the values in the database.

This example uses the Init method to create a SessionSettings object that includes the
current client user's personalization settings from the database, and then uses the
Company method to set the company to 'MyCompany'. Finally, the
RequestSessionUpdate method sends a request that saves the SessionSettings object
property values to the database and starts a new client session that uses the new
company.

# System.CalcDate(Text [, Date]) Method

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Calculates a new date that is based on a date expression and a reference date.

```
AL
```
_DateExpression_
Type: Text
The date expression can be any length. The string is interpreted from left to right with
one subexpression at a time. The following rules describe the valid syntax of date
expressions:

```
DateExpression = [<Subexpression>][<Subexpression>][<Subexpression>]
<Subexpression> = [<Sign>] <Term>- <Sign> = + | -
<Term> = <Number><Unit> | <Unit><Number> | <Prefix><Unit>
<Number> = Positive integer
<Unit> = D | WD | W | M | Q | Y (D=day, WD=weekday, W=week, M=month,
Q=quarter, Y=year)
<Prefix> = C (C=current) These production rules show that date expressions
consist of zero, one, two, or three subexpressions. Each subexpression consists of
an optional sign and a term. The following are some typical examples of terms:
30D (30 days; corresponds to <Number><Unit>)
WD2 (weekday number 2; corresponds to <Unit><Number>)
CW (current week; corresponds to <Prefix><Unit>) The internal calendar starts on
Monday and ends on Sunday. This means that Monday is weekday 1 and Sunday is
```
## Syntax

```
NewDate := System.CalcDate(DateExpression: Text [, Date: Date])
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
```
## Parameters


```
weekday 7. A run-time error occurs if the syntax of DateExpression is incorrect.
```
_[Optional] Date_
Type: Date
Use this optional parameter to define a reference date. The default is the current system
date. If you omit this optional value, the current system date is used.

_NewDate_
Type: Date

DateExpression can be a field or variable of type Text or Code, and it can be a field or
variable of type DateFormula. The benefit of using a DateFormula field or variable is that
the date formula becomes language independent.

The user can enter formulas in the currently selected language. The formula is stored in
a generic format in a field or variable. When the formula must be displayed, the actual
string that is displayed is converted to the currently selected language.

For example, if a user who has language set to ENG (English) enters the date formula
"1W+1D" for one week and one day, then a user who has the language set to FRA
(French) sees "1S+1J," and a user who has the language set to ESP (Spanish) sees
"1S+1D".

If a date formula is entered with < > delimiters surrounding it, then the date formula is
stored in a generic, nonlanguage-dependent format. This makes it possible to develop
date formulas that are not dependent on the currently selected language.

For more information about how to calculate the duration between two DateTimes, see
Duration Data Type.

This code example shows how to use the production rules that were previously
described.

```
AL
```
### Return Value

### Remarks

### Example 1


This should be interpreted as the following: current quarter + 1 month - 10 days.

The DateExpression is composed of the following:

<Prefix><Unit><Sign><Number><Unit><Sign><Number><Unit>

This example shows how to use the CalcDate method.

```
AL
```
The message window displays the following text:

**The reference date is: 05/21/96**

```
<CQ+ 1 M- 10 D>

The angle brackets (< >) specify that the expression is not translated, regardless of
the application language.

# System.Clear(var Array of [Any]) Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Clears the value of a single variable. Also, it clears all the filters that were set if the
variable is a record and resets the key to the primary key and the company on a record
variable.

```
AL
```
_Variable_
Type: Any
The identifier (variable) of any AL data type, including simple and composite data types.
The following rules apply when you run the CLEAR method:

```
A number variable is set to 0 (zero)
A string variable is set to empty string
A date variable is set to 0D (undefined date)
A time variable is set to 0T (undefined time)
A Boolean variable is set to FALSE
```
Use the ClearAll Method to clear all internal variables, keys, and filters in the object and
in any associated objects such as reports, pages, and codeunits that contain AL code.
Note, however, that ClearAll Method does not affect or change values for variables in
single instance codeunits.

## Syntax

```
System.Clear(var Variable: Array of [Any])
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
```
## Parameters

## Remarks


For a composite data type, such as a record or an array, all elements are cleared.
Furthermore, all fields in a record will be initialized with the InitValue Property of the
field.

**Clear** can also be used on the Guid Data Type. It converts the GUID to zeros. Use the
CreateGuid Method (Guid) to create a new unique GUID.

**Clear** can also be used to deselect a company. For more information, see
ChangeCompany Method (Record).

If you use **Clear** on a codeunit, only the reference to the codeunit is deleted and not the
codeunit itself, as with Automation objects. This means that the content of the codeunit
stays intact.

If you have an array of controls, the whole array is destroyed when the array variable
goes out of scope.

If you have an array of automation servers, you may clear the whole array at once, or
clear each element individually.

This example shows how to use the **Clear** method.

```
AL
```
The first message window displays the following:

**Initially the variable "Name" contains: >;Joe Raybon>**

The second message window displays the following:

**After using Clear, the variable "Name" contains: >;>**

### Example 1

```
var
Text000: Label 'Joe Raybon';
Text001: Label 'Initially the variable "Name" contains: >;%1\>';
Text002: Label 'After using Clear, the variable "Name" contains:
>;%1\>';
begin
Name := Text000;
Message(Text001, Name);
Clear(Name);
Message(Text002, Name);
end;
```

In the following example you will declare two variables:

```
AL
```
These variables will be declared and cleared, first by using **Clear** and then by using
ClearAll Method.

```

```
The first message window displays the following:

**Initially the variable "MyTextVar" contains: >;My Text> and "GuidVar" is defined as

```
```

Text001: Label 'Initially the variable "MyTextVar" contains >;%1> and
"GuidVar" is defined as >;%2>';
Text002: Label 'After using Clear(MyTextVar), the variable "MyTextVar"

# System.ClearAll() Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Clears all internal variables (except REC variables), keys, and filters in the object and in
any associated objects, such as reports, pages, codeunits, and so on that contain AL
code.

```
AL
```
ClearAll works by calling the Clear Method repeatedly on each variable. However, this is
not the case with codeunits, where the ClearAll method works by calling ClearAll inside
the codeunit. It deletes the contents of the codeunit, whereas Clear only deletes the
reference to the codeunit.

ClearAll does not affect or change values for variables in single instance codeunits.

When a method is called repeatedly in the same transaction, the system retains all
values for variables and filters in memory between calls. For example, this is used to
assign numbers to entry numbers when posting. When you do not want to retain the
values in memory, use the ClearAll method to clear them.

For information about the initial values of cleared variables, see the Clear Method. Take
into consideration that fields in a record will be initialized with the InitValue Property of
the field.

# System.ClosingDate(Date) Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Gets the closing date for a Date Data Type.

```
AL
```
_Date_
Type: Date
The input date.

_ClosingDate_
Type: Date

All dates have a corresponding closing date. A closing date is a period in time following
the given date but before the next regular date. Closing dates are sorted immediately
after the corresponding regular date but before the next regular date.

xxxxxxD: Regular date

xxxxxxC: Closing date

## Syntax

```
ClosingDate := System.ClosingDate(Date: Date)
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


The compiler cannot convert the expression xxxxxxC to a Date data type. Therefore, you
must use the ClosingDate method to create a closing date.

The first example shows how to use the ClosingDate method. A regular date is given as
input.

```
AL
```
The following message is displayed:

**The closing date for 04/04/14 is C04/04/14.**

The second example shows some statements that do not work and explains why they do
not work.

```

```
### Example 1

```
var
Date1: Date;
CloDate: Date;
Text000: Label 'The closing date for %1 is %2.';
begin
Date1 := 20140404 D;
CloDate := ClosingDate(Date1);
Message(Text000, Date1, CloDate);
end;
```
### Example 2

```
var
Date1: Date;
CloDate1: Date;
CloDate2: Date;
Text000: Label 'The closing date for %1 is %2.';
begin
// Date1 := 20140404C;
// The previous statement does not compile because the compiler
// cannot convert '20140404C' to a Date data type.
Date1 := 20140404 D;
// The previous statement compiles.
// The compiler converts '20140404D' to a Date data type.
// CloDate1 := ClosingDate(20140505C);
// The previous statement does not compile because the compiler
// cannot convert '20140505C' to a Date data type and the ClosingDate
// method requires a Date data type for its parameter.

# System.CompressArray(Array of [Text])

# Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Moves all non-empty strings (text) in an array to the beginning of the array. The
resulting StringArray has the same number of elements as the input array, but empty
entries appear at the end of the array.

```
AL
```
_StringArray_
Type: Text
The string array that you want to compress.

_[Optional] Count_
Type: Integer

When compressing an array of strings, the non-empty strings in the resulting array are
sorted just like in the original array.

## Syntax

```
[Count := ] System.CompressArray(StringArray: Array of [Text])
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


The **CompressArray** method is useful for printing names and addresses. For instance,
you can use this method to remove blank lines in account statements.

This method compresses an array of Text or Code, but not BigText. The compression is
performed by moving empty strings to the end of the array.

For example, "Redmond", "Copenhagen", "", "Fargo", "Paris" is changed to "Redmond",
"Copenhagen", "Fargo", "Paris", "".

In Dynamics 365 Business Central, it is not supported to use the **CompressArray** method
on multidimensional arrays. In earlier versions, **CompressArray** works for arrays of
arrays.

This example shows how to use the **CompressArray** method. The input array has the
following values: Joe Raybon, One Meca Way, Atlanta.

The output StringArray has the following values: Joe Raybon, One Meca Way, Atlanta.

All non-empty entries have been moved to the beginning of the array.

```
AL
```
The first message window displays the following:

**Before compression, the address is:**

**Joe Raybon**

### Example

```
var
CustomerData: array[ 6 ] of Text;
begin
CustomerData[ 1 ] := 'Joe Raybon';
CustomerData[ 2 ] := ''; // Empty string.
CustomerData[ 3 ] :='One Meca Way';
CustomerData[ 4 ] := ' '; // A non-empty string that contains blanks.
CustomerData[ 5 ] := 'Atlanta';
CustomerData[ 6 ] := ''; // Empty string.
Message('Before compression the address is: \%1\%2\%3\%4\%5\%6',
CustomerData[ 1 ], CustomerData[ 2 ], CustomerData[ 3 ], CustomerData[ 4 ],
CustomerData[ 5 ], CustomerData[ 6 ]);
CompressArray(CustomerData); // The empty lines (strings) are removed.
Message('After compression the address is: \%1\%2\%3\%4\%5\%6',

# System.CopyArray(Array of [Any], Array

# of [Any], Integer [, Integer]) Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Copies one or more elements in an array to a new array.

```
AL
```
_NewArray_
Type: Any
The array to copy to; the destination array.

_Array_
Type: Any

_Position_
Type: Integer
The position of the first array element to copy.

_[Optional] Length_
Type: Integer
The number of array elements to copy. If you do not specify Length, all array elements
are copied from Position to the last element. Use the following equation to determine
valid values. 1 =< LENGTH =< MAXLEN(ARRAY) - POSITION + 1

## Syntax

```
System.CopyArray(NewArray: Array of [Any], Array: Array of [Any], Position:
Integer [, Length: Integer])
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
```
## Parameters


You can only copy from one-dimensional arrays. Repeat the CopyArray method to copy
two-dimensional and three-dimensional arrays.

You cannot copy an array if the data type of the array is a complex data type. For more
information about complex data types, see AL Data Types.

The following example assigns values to Array1 and copies values from Array1 to Array2.
Array1 is an integer array with the Dimensions Property set to 10. It contains integers
from 1 to 10. The example code copies the numbers 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 to Array2, an
integer array with the **Dimensions** property set to 5.

```
AL
```
If Array1 is an integer array with dimension 10, and it contains the numbers from 1 to
10, and Array2 is an integer array with dimension 5, then the following command causes
a run-time error.

```
AL
```
### Remarks

### Example 1

```
var
Array1: array[ 10 ] of Integer;
Array2: array[ 5 ] of Integer;
begin
Array1[ 1 ] := 1 ;
Array1[ 2 ] := 2 ;
Array1[ 3 ] := 3 ;
Array1[ 4 ] := 4 ;
Array1[ 5 ] := 5 ;
Array1[ 6 ] := 6 ;
Array1[ 7 ] := 7 ;
Array1[ 8 ] := 8 ;
Array1[ 9 ] := 9 ;
Array1[ 10 ] := 10 ;
COPYARRAY(Array2,Array1, 6 , 5 );
end;
```
### Example 2

```
CopyArray(Array2,Array1, 3 );
```

The error occurs because the code attempts to copy eight elements from Array1 to
Array2, and Array2 has room for only five elements.

# System.Date2DWY(Date, Integer)

# Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Gets the day of the week, week number, or year of a Date Data Type.

```
AL
```
_Date_
Type: Date
The input date.

_Value_
Type: Integer
Specifies what the function returns. The valid options are 1, 2, and 3.

```
The value 1 corresponds to day of the week (1-7, Monday = 1).

```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
```
## Parameters

## Return Value


When the input date to the **Date2DWY** method is in a week that spans two years, the
**Date2DWY** method computes the output year as the year that has the most days. For
example, the input date is 010114. This date is in a week that starts on Monday,
December 29, 2013, and ends Sunday, January 4, 2014. The week has three days in 2013
and four days in 2014. So the output year is 2014.

This example shows a special case that occurs when you use the **Date2DWY** method in a
week that spans two years.

```
AL
```
The message window displays the following information:

**The date 01/01/14 corresponds to:**

**The day of the week: 4**

### Remarks

```
） Important
```
```
Date2DWY always uses the ISO week-numbering year scheme for the week,
regardless of the server or device configuration. This means that week 01 of a year
is the week that includes the first Thursday of the Gregorian year. Or in other
words, the week that includes 4 January.
```
### Example

```
var
InputDate: Date;
DayOfWeek: Integer;
WeekNumber: Integer;
Year: Integer;
Text000: Label 'The date %1 corresponds to:\\';
Text001: Label 'The day of the week: %2\\';
Text002: Label 'The week number: %3\\';
Text003: Label 'The year: %4';

```
## Parameters

## Return Value


_Date_
Type: Date

A special situation occurs if the week ( _Week_ ) that is input into DWY2Date spans two
years. Depending on _Weekday_ , the year of the output _Date_ can differ from the input
year. This scenario is shown in the following code example.

The input week in this example spans two years.

```
AL
```
On a computer that has the regional format set to English (United States), the message
window displays the following:

**Day 1 of week 1 in the year 2014 is the date: 12/30/13.**

The example shows that the first day of the week in the first week of the year 2014 is
regarded as the date December 30, 2013. The first week of the year 2014 is the first
week that has four or more days in the year 2014. That week starts on Monday,
December 30, 2013, and ends on Sunday, January 5, 2014.

The input week in this example spans two years.

```
AL
```
### Remarks

### Example 1

```
var
DayOfWeek: Integer;
Week: Integer;
Year: Integer;
OutputDate: Date;
Text000: Label"Day %1 of week %2 in the year %3 is the date %4.";
begin
DayOfWeek := 1 ;
Week := 1 ;
Year := 2014 ;
OutputDate := DWY2Date(DayOfWeek, Week, Year);
Message(Text000, DayOfWeek, Week, Year, OutputDate);
end;
```
### Example 2


On a computer that has the regional format set to English (United States), the message
window displays the following:

**Day 1 of week 1 in the year 2016 is the date: 01/04/16.**

The example shows that the first day of the week in the first week of the year 2016 is
regarded as the date January 4, 2016. The first week of the year 2016 is the first week
that has four or more days in the year 2016. That week starts on Monday, January 4,
2016, and ends on Sunday, January 11, 2015.

This example shows how to use the DWY2Date method without specifying the optional
_Year_ parameter. The output in this example depends on the day on which you run the
code.

```
AL
```
On a computer that has the regional format set to English (United States), if you ran the
code on January 1, 2014, then the message window displays the following:

```
var
DayOfWeek: Integer;
Week: Integer;
Year: Integer;
OutputDate: Date;
Text000: Label"Day %1 of week %2 in the year %3 is the date %4.";
begin
DayOfWeek := 1 ;
Week := 1 ;
Year := 2016 ;
OutputDate := DWY2Date(DayOfWeek, Week, Year);

**Day 1 of week 1 is the date: 12/30/13.**

If you do not specify the year, then the year of the current week is used. On January 1,
2014, the current week is the week that starts on December 30, 2013 and ends on
January 5, 2014. This week has four days in 2014 so the year of the current week is 2014.
The first day of the first week of 2014 is 12/30/13.

On a computer that has the regional format set to English (United States), if you ran the
code on January 1, 2016, then the message window displays the following:

**Day 1 of week 1 is the date: 12/29/14.**

On January 1, 2016, the current week is the week that starts on December 28, 2015 and
ends on January 3, 2016. This week has four days in 2015 so the year of the current week

This example shows that although Value ('010196') can be interpreted as both an integer
and a date expression, it can't be interpreted as a Boolean expression. This causes an
error, shown in the return code Ok3 (=False).

This example also shows that when you evaluate a string as a duration data type, you
can use certain words in the string to describe the duration. The following words or
abbreviations are supported:

```
day, days, d
```
```
hour, hours, h
```
```
minute, minutes, min, m
```
```
second, seconds, sec, s
```
```
millisecond, milliseconds, milli, millis
```
You can include decimal values in the string that you evaluate as a duration, except for
milliseconds, which must be a whole number.

```
Returns a password protected temporary filepath containing the encryption key. When
encrypting or decrypting data in Dynamics 365 Business Central, an encryption key is
used. A single key is used per tenant and every tenant will have a different key. Keys can
be exported to a file which may be necessary in the case of upgrading or migrating a
system from one set of hardware to another. The EXPORTENCRYPTIONKEY method
allows an administrator to specify a destination file for the key and specify a password
protection for the file.

```

Formats a value into a string.

```
AL
```
_Value_
Type: Any
This is an AL variable (expression) of any simple data type, such as Option, Integer,
BigInteger, Decimal, Char, Text, Code, Date, Time, DateTime, Boolean, or GUID. If, when
the system formats Value, the result is a value larger than the maximum length
MAXSTRLEN method (Code, Text) of String, a run-time error occurs.

_Length_
Type: Integer
This optional parameter specifies the length of String.

_FormatString_
Type: Text
A literal string that defines a format as in the Format Property.

## Syntax

```
String := System.Format(Value: Any, Length: Integer, FormatString: Text)
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
```
## Parameters

## Return Value


_String_
Type: Text

For the _Length_ parameter, the following rules apply:

```
If Length = 0 then the entire value is returned (default).
```
```
If Length > 0 then the returned string will be exactly Length characters.
```
```
If Value is less than Length characters, then either leading or trailing spaces are
inserted, depending on the format that you select.
```
```
If Value exceeds Length characters, then String is truncated to Length characters.
```
```
If Length < 0 then the returned string will not have leading or trailing spaces.
```
```
If Value is less than Length characters, the length of String will equal the length of
Value.
```
```
If Value exceeds Length characters, then String is truncated to Length characters.
```
For more information, see Formatting Values, Dates, and Time.

```
AL
```
The Regional and Language settings on the computer on which you run the code affect
how the string is displayed. For example, on a computer that has the regional format set
to English (United States), the message window displays the following:

**The formatted value: > 123,456.78-<
The formatted value: > 123,456.78-<**

### Remarks

### Example 1

```
var
Text000: Label 'The formatted value >%1<';
begin
Message(Text000, Format(-123456.78, 12 , 3 ));
Message(Text000, Format(-123456.78, 12 , '<Standard Format,3>'));

If you call the Codeunit.Run method to run a codeunit and an error occurs in the
codeunit, then the error is displayed. However, if you also use the return value of the
Codeunit.Run method, then the error is not displayed. In this case, you can use the
GetLastErrorText method to determine whether an error has occurred and to see the text
of the last error message that was generated. This example shows how to use the
GetLastErrorText method. This example requires that you create two codeunits. Codeunit
50001 generates an error. Codeunit 50002 runs codeunit 50001 and if an error occurs,
then it displays the text of the error.

```
AL
```
In this example, because the if statement uses the return value of the Codeunit.Run
method, the error from codeunit 50001 is not displayed. Instead, you use the
GetLastErrorText method to display the error.

When you run codeunit 50002, the message window displays the following:

**The last error was: Some error message.**

The System.GuiAllowed method returns true if the session where your AL code is

running allows you to use methods that interact with the user, such as Dialog.Open,
Dialog.Update, or Dialog.Close.

If the same codeunit needs to run both in the UI but also in the background (in a
scheduled task or with a job queue entry) or in a web service call (SOAP/OData/API),
then use if GuiAllowed() then calls to encapsulate AL code that interact with the user.

The HyperLink method does not work on NAS services.

The following example shows two uses of the HyperLink method to open the specified
URL in the default browser. In the first line of code, the URL is specified in code. The
second line of code illustrates how you can get a URL that is stored in a field on the
current table.

```

```
When using the file:// protocol to open a file, the file should be stored on a
network file share, not locally; otherwise the file will not open. Browsers block
hyperlinks to files from a web page for security reasons and the hyperlink must be
manually copied and pasted into a manually opened tab page.
```
### Example

```
HyperLink('https://www.microsoft.com');

# System.ImportEncryptionKey(Text, Text)

# Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Points to a password protected file that contains the key on the current server. When
encrypting or decrypting data in Dynamics 365 Business Central, an encryption key is
used. A single key is used per tenant, and every tenant will have a different key. Keys can
be created or imported if one exists already, as may be the case if upgrading or
migrating a system from one set of hardware to another. The IMPORTENCRYPTIONKEY
method allows an administrator to specify a file (password protected) which contains a
key and imports it to the current Dynamics 365 Business Central service.

```
AL
```
_Path_
Type: Text
Specifies the file that contains the encryption key.

_Password_
Type: Text
Specifies the password the protects the file.

```
７ Note
```
```
This method is supported only in Business Central on-premises.
```
## Syntax

```
[Ok := ] System.ImportEncryptionKey(Path: Text, Password: Text)
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
```
## Parameters


_[Optional] Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return
value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

If the import key file cannot be imported, the following error will be displayed: **Import
Failed. The provided encryption key file contains invalid data and could not be
imported**.

This code example uses the EncryptionEnabled and EncryptionExists methods to do a
check before importing the encryption key.

This example requires that you create a text constant ServerFileName.

```
AL
```
### Return Value

### Remarks

### Example

```
if EncryptionEnabled then
if EncryptionExists then
if not Confirm('Encryption has been enabled and the server already
contains an encryption key.\'
+ 'Importing a key will overwrite any existing key and may result
in lost data.\\'
+ 'Do you wish to continue?') then
exit
else
if not Confirm('Importing a key different from the already
configured key will result in data corruption.\\'
+ 'Do you wish to continue?') then
exit
if not Upload('Upload encrypted key','','Encrypted Key File
(*.ekey)|*.ekey','ExportedKey.ekey',ServerFileName) then
Exit;
ImportEncryptionKey(ServerFileName,'This is my personal secret');
Erase(ServerFileName);

# System.IsNullGuid(Guid) Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Indicates whether a value has been assigned to a GUID. A null GUID that consists only of
zeros is valid but must never be used for references.

```
AL
```
_Guid_
Type: Guid
The GUID that you want to check whether it is null.

_Ok_
Type: Boolean

A GUID is a 16-byte binary data type that can be logically grouped into the following
subgroups: 4byte-2byte-2byte-2byte-6byte.

The GUID data type is useful when you want to uniquely identify data so that it can be
exchanged with external applications. For example, if you want to transfer an item

## Syntax

```
Ok := System.IsNullGuid(Guid: Guid)
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


catalog to an external application, you add a GUID field to the record in the table and
use it as the primary reference when you communicate with the external application.

The following example initializes two variables named validGuid and nullGuid. The

validGuid variable is assigned a valid GUID value, and the nullGuid variable is assigned
a null GUID that consists of only zeros. The IsNullGuid method determines whether the

GUID that's contained in the validGuid variable is null. In this case, the GUID validGuid

isn't null so a message that states that the GUID isn't null is displayed and the value is
displayed. The method then checks the nullGuid parameter. This time, a message that
states that the GUID is null, is displayed because the GUID is a null GUID that consists of
only zeros.

# System.Power(Decimal, Decimal)

# Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Raises a number to a power. For example, you can use this method to square the
number 2 to get the result of 4.

```
AL
```
_Number_
Type: Decimal
The number you want to raise exponentially. This number is the base in the exponential
method.

_Power_
Type: Decimal
The exponent in the exponential method.

_NewNumber_
Type: Decimal

## Syntax

```
NewNumber := System.Power(Number: Decimal, Power: Decimal)
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Example 1


```
AL
```
On a computer that has the regional format set to English (United States), the first
message window displays the following:

**64 raised to the power of 0.5 = 8**

This example shows that raising a number to the power of 0.5 corresponds to the square
root of the number.

This example shows a typical use for the POWER method.

If a principal amount P is deposited at interest rate R and compounded annually, then at
the end of N years, the accumulated amount (A) is:

A = P(1 + R)

For example, you put LCY 2800 into a bank account that pays 5 percent, which is
compounded quarterly. To determine what the amount will be in eight years, you must
consider:

N = 32 payment periods (8 years times 4 quarterly periods)

R = 0.0125 per period (5 percent divided by 4 quarterly periods)

The accumulated amount A is:

A = LCY 2800(1 + 0.0125) =LCY 2800(1.4881) = LCY 4166.77

If a principal amount P is deposited at the end of each year at interest rate R (in decimal
notation) compounded annually, then at the end of N years, the accumulated amount is:

A = P[((1 + R) - 1)/R]

```
var
Number1: Decimal;
Power1: Decimal;
Result1: Decimal;
Text000: Label '%1 raised to the power of %2 = %3';
begin
Number1 := 64 ;
Power1 := 0.5;
Result1 := Power(Number1, Power1);
Message(Text000, Number1, Power1, Result1);
end;
```
### Example 2

```
N
```
```
32
```
```
N
```

This is typically called an _annuity_.

For example, you have an annuity in which a payment of LCY 500 is made at the end of
each year. The interest on this annuity is 4 percent, which is compounded annually. To
determine what the annuity will be worth in 20 years, you must consider:

R = 0.04

N = 20

The amount of the annuity A will be:

A = LCY 500[((1 + 0.04) - 1)/0.04 = LCY 14,889.04

Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Rounds the value of a numeric variable.

```
AL
```
_Number_
Type: Decimal
The number that you want to round.

_[Optional] Precision_
Type: Decimal
This optional parameter determines the precision used when rounding. If you do not
specify a Precision parameter, then the following steps are used to specify the precision:

1. The method ReadRounding in Codeunit 45, ReadRounding, is called.
    ReadRounding returns a decimal value that is the precision. By default, the
    ReadRounding method returns the Amount Rounding Precision field from the
    GLSetup table.
2. If you have customized Codeunit 45 and it does not implement the ReadRounding
    method, then the precision is specified as 2 digits after the decimal.

## Syntax

NewNumber := System.Round(Number: Decimal [, Precision: Decimal] [,
Direction: Text])
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.

# System.RoundDateTime(DateTime [,

# BigInteger] [, Text]) Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Rounds a DateTime.

```
AL
```
_Datetime_
Type: DateTime
The DateTime that you want to round.

_[Optional] Precision_
Type: BigInteger
This optional parameter determines the precision used when rounding. The default
value is 1000, which rounds to the nearest second. You can only use positive BigIntegers.

_[Optional] Direction_
Type: Text
This optional parameter specifies how to round the DateTime. The default rounding
method is '='. You can change the method by using the following options:

```
'=' rounds up or down to the nearest value (default). Values of 5 or greater are
rounded up. Values less than 5 are rounded down.
'>' rounds up
```
## Syntax

```
NewDatetime := System.RoundDateTime(Datetime: DateTime [, Precision:
BigInteger] [, Direction: Text])
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
```
## Parameters


```
'<' rounds down
```
_NewDatetime_
Type: DateTime
The rounded result.

A variable of type DateTime is stored as a 64 bit integer. The integer value is the number
of milliseconds since year 0. When you call RoundDateTime, the DateTime integer value
is rounded as a numeric variable.

If you use 1 for the _Precision_ parameter, then the resulting DateTime is rounded to the
nearest millisecond. If you use 1000 for the _Precision_ parameter, which is the default
value, then the resulting DateTime will be rounded to the nearest second.

We recommend that you do not use a value greater than 60*60*1000, which is the
number of milliseconds in an hour, for the _Precision_ parameter. The Regional and
Language Options in Windows affect how the hour and date parts of a DateTime are
rounded. To display a DateTime in a specific format, we recommend that you use the
Format method instead of the RoundDateTime method.

This example shows how to use the RoundDateTime method to round to the nearest
second.

Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Adds a task to be run by the task scheduler. The task is ensured to not run before the
specified time.

```
AL
```
_CodeunitId_
Type: Integer
Specifies the ID of the codeunit to run.

_FailureCodeunitId_
Type: Integer
Specifies the ID of the codeunit to run if the task fails. If you do not want to provide a
failure codeunit, then use 0.

_[Optional] IsReady_
Type: Boolean
Sets the task to the ready state. A task cannot run unless it is ready.

_[Optional] Company_
Type: Text
Specifies the company to run the task for. If you do not specify a company, the task will
run in the user’s current company.

## Syntax

```
[Task := ] TaskScheduler.CreateTask(CodeunitId: Integer, FailureCodeunitId:
Integer [, IsReady: Boolean] [, Company: Text] [, NotBefore: DateTime] [,
RecordID: RecordId])
```
## Parameters


_[Optional] NotBefore_
Type: DateTime
Specifies the date and time that you want to run the task. When the task actually runs
will depend on whether other tasks are running at the same time. The task will run the
first opportunity on or after the date and time that you specify.

_[Optional] RecordID_
Type: RecordId
Specifies the recordID of the record that you want to run the task on.

_[Optional] Task_
Type: Guid

Scheduled tasks are shown in the **Scheduled Tasks** page in the client. The
TaskScheduler.CreateTask method creates a task and if the operation is successful, the
task appears on the page (the implementation is different for the on-premises version
compared to the online version of Business Central).

If one or both of the codeunits provided to TaskScheduler.CreateTask don't exist, then

the method will throw an error at runtime.

The TaskScheduler.CreateTask method also has a version that allows you to set a

timeout parameter. For more information, see CreateTask(Integer, Integer, Boolean, Text,
DateTime, RecordId, Duration)

For more information about the task scheduler, see Using the Task Scheduler.

### Return Value

### Remarks

```
７ Note
```
```
The first two parameters in TaskScheduler.CreateTask are integers, which represent
the object IDs of codeunits. To code robustly, never supply the object ID directly in
your code as numbers. Instead, use the :: operator as illustrated in the example
above. With this technique, if any of the codeunits don't exist, you'll get a compile
time error instead of a runtime error.
```

The following example opens table 18 (Customer) as a RecordRef variable that is named
CustomerRecref. The code uses the Field Method (RecordRef) to loop through field 1
through 9 and creates a FieldRef variable that is named MyFieldRef. For each field, the
Caption method retrieves the caption of the field, stores it in the varCaption variable
and displays it in a message box.

```
```
Deletes chars contained in the which parameter in a string based on the
contents on the where parameter. If the where parameter contains an
equal-sign, then all occurrences of characters in which is deleted from the
current value. If the where parameter contains a less-than, then the
characters are only deleted when they are first in the string. If the where
parameter contains a greater-than, then the characters are only deleted
when they are the last in the string. If the where parameter contains any
other char, an exception is thrown. If the where parameter or the which
parameter is empty, the source is returned unmodified. The which
parameter is to be considered as an array of chars to delete where the
order does not matter.
```
```
DelStr(Text, Integer
[, Integer])
```
```
Deletes a substring inside a string (text or code).
```
```
IncStr(Text) Increases a positive number or decrease a negative number inside a string

The **Text** data type is a value type, such that every time you use a method on it, you
create a new string object in memory. This requires a new allocation of space. In
situations where you need to perform repeated modifications to a string, the overhead
associated with creating a **Text** data type can be costly.

The TextBuilder Data Type is a reference type, which holds a pointer elsewhere in
memory. For performance reasons, we recommend you to use it when you want to
modify a string without creating a new object. For example, using TextBuilder Data Type
can boost performance when concatenating many strings together in a loop.

# Text.DelChr(Text [, Text] [, Text]) Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Deletes chars contained in the which parameter in a string based on the contents on the
where parameter. If the where parameter contains an equal-sign, then all occurrences of
characters in which is deleted from the current value. If the where parameter contains a
less-than, then the characters are only deleted when they are first in the string. If the
where parameter contains a greater-than, then the characters are only deleted when
they are the last in the string. If the where parameter contains any other char, an
exception is thrown. If the where parameter or the which parameter is empty, the source
is returned unmodified. The which parameter is to be considered as an array of chars to
delete where the order does not matter.

```
AL
```
_String_
Type: Text
The input string.

_[Optional] Where_
Type: Text
Specifies where to delete characters.

_[Optional] Which_
Type: Text
Specifies the characters that you want to delete.

## Syntax

```
NewString := Text.DelChr(String: Text [, Where: Text] [, Which: Text])
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
```
## Parameters


_NewString_
Type: Text
The end result String.

The DelChr method is case-sensitive.

If you omit the _Which_ parameter, then the method deletes spaces from _String_ based on
the contents of the _Where_ parameter as follows:

```
If Where contains =, then all the spaces are deleted from String.
If Where contains <, then all the spaces at the start of String are deleted.
If Where contains >, then all the spaces at the end of String are deleted.
If Where contains any other character, then an error is returned.
If Where is empty, then String is returned unchanged.
```
If you use the _Where_ and the _Which_ parameters, then the method deletes from _String_
the characters that are contained in the _Which_ parameter based on the contents of the
_Where_ parameter as follows:

```
If Where contains =, then every occurrence of the characters in Which are deleted
from String.
If Where contains <, then the characters in Which are only deleted if they occur at
the start of String.
If Where contains >, then the characters in Which are deleted only if they occur at
the end of String.
If Where contains any other character, then an error is returned.
If Where is empty, then String is returned unchanged.
If Which is empty, then String is returned unchanged.
```
The _Which_ parameter contains an array of the characters that you want to delete. The
order of the characters is of no significance. If _String_ contains a character that is
specified in _Which_ , it is deleted from _String_.

```
AL
```

```
AL
```
_String_
Type: Text
The input string.

_Position_
Type: Integer
The position of the first character that you want to delete. Position must be greater than
zero (0). If Position exceeds the length of String, DELSTR returns the original string,
unchanged.

_[Optional] Length_

## Return Value


_NewString_
Type: Text
The input string without the specified substring.

If you omit _Length_ , all the characters starting with _Position_ are deleted until the end of
the string.

If you omit _Length_ and _Position_ is less than 1, then an error is returned.

If you omit _Length_ and _Position_ is greater than the length of _String_ , then _String_ is
returned unchanged.

```

# Text.IncStr(Text) Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Increases a positive number or decrease a negative number inside a string by one (1).

```
AL
```
_String_
Type: Text
The string that you want to increase or decrease.

_NewString_
Type: Text
The incremented string.

If _String_ contains more than one number, then only the number closest to the end of the
string is changed. For example, 'A10B20' is changed to 'A10B21' and 'a12b12c' to
'a12b13c'.

If _String_ contains a negative number, then it is decreased by one. For example, '-55' is
changed to '-56'.

## Syntax

```
NewString := Text.IncStr(String: Text)
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


Zero (0) is considered a positive number. Therefore, it is increased it by one. For
example, 'A0' is changed to 'A1'.

When _String_ contains a number such as 99, it is increased to 100 and the length of the
output string is: LEN(String) + 1. For example, 'a12b99c' is changed to 'a12b100c'.

If _String_ does not contain any number, the output string is an empty string. For example,
'aaa' is changed to ''.

IncStr only increments integer numbers within strings, not decimals. For example, if you
call IncStr on the string **a99.99b** then the result is **a99.100b**.

```
AL
```
The first message displays the following:

**The text strings before IncStr is called:**

**Account no. 99 does not balance.**

**Account no. 2342 shows a total of $ -452.**

**My bank account is empty.**

**My bank account shows a total of $ 0.**

The second message displays the following:

**The text strings after IncStr has been called:**

**Account no. 100 does not balance.**

**Account no. 2342 shows a total of $ -453.**

**My bank account shows a total of $ 1.**

The example shows that if the string contains more than one number, only the last
number is changed. Furthermore, positive numbers and zero are increased and negative
numbers are decreased. Finally, if there are no numbers in the string, then an empty
string is returned.

# Text.StrCheckSum(Text [, Text] [,

# Integer]) Method

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Calculates a checksum for a string that contains a number. If the source is empty, 0 is
returned. Each char in the source and in the weight must be a numeric character 0-9,
otherwise an exception is thrown. If the WeightString parameter is shorter then the
source, it is padded with '1' up until the length of source. If the WeightString parameter
is longer than the source, an exception is thrown.

```
AL
```
_String_
Type: Text
This string contains the number for which you want to calculate a checksum. You can
only enter the numeric characters 0-9 in this string. If you enter anything else, a run-
time error will occur. If String is empty, 0 is returned.

_[Optional] WeightString_
Type: Text
This string contains numbers that you want to use as weights when calculating the
checksum. The default value is a string that contains STRLEN(String) '1'-characters.

_[Optional] Modulus_
Type: Integer

## Syntax

```
CheckNumber := Text.StrCheckSum(String: Text [, WeightString: Text] [,
Modulus: Integer])
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
```
## Parameters


The number that you want to use in the checksum formula. The default value is 10.

_CheckNumber_
Type: Integer
The resulting checksum value.

This example shows how to use the StrCheckSum method to calculate a checksum.

```
AL

The formula is:

(7 - (4x1 + 3x2 + 7x3 + 8x4) MOD 7) MOD 7=0

The message window displays the following:

**The number: 4378**

**has the checksum: 0**

This example shows how to use the StrCheckSum method to calculate a modulus 10
checksum for a bar code.

The StrCheckSum method can be used to calculate checksums for 13- and 8-digit
European Article Number (EAN) and EAN-compatible bar codes such as a Universal

### Return Value

### Example 1

```
var
StrNumber: Text[ 30 ];
Weight: Text[ 30 ];

```
### Example 2


#### Feedback

Product Code (UPC) or Japanese Article Number (JAN).

A 13-digit EAN code has the following format:

1. The 12 digits in positions 13 to 2 are used to calculate the checksum at position 1.
2. Starting with position 2, all even values are totaled. The result is then multiplied by
    three. This value is called Even.
3. Starting with position 3, all odd values are totaled. The result is called Odd.
4. Total=Even + Odd.
5. The modulus 10 checksum is then (10 - Total MOD 10) MOD 10.

# Text.StrSubstNo(Text [, Any,...]) Method

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Replaces %1, %2, %3... and #1, #2, #3... fields in a string with the values you provide as
optional parameters.

```
AL
```
_String_
Type: Text
A string containing '#' and/or '%' fields.

_[Optional] Value1_
Type: Any
One or more values (expressions) that you want to insert into String. You can specify up
to 10 values.

_NewString_
Type: Text
Returns a new string with the provided values inserted into the specified string.

## Syntax

```
NewString := Text.StrSubstNo(String: Text [, Value1: Any,...])
```
```
７ Note
```
```
This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
```
## Parameters

## Return Value

## Remarks


This method replaces the numbered specifiers in a string with a string representation of
the equivalent numbered value.

The specifiers in the string can be either % _n_ or ####### _n_ , where _n_ represents a 1-based
number. When you use the # specifier, the number can be anywhere in the specifier. For
example, ###2#### is allowed.

The % _n_ specifier is replaced with the string representation of the value with their full
lengths.

The ## _n_ specifier is replaced with the same number of characters as the length of the
specifier (including the number). The values are truncated to the length of the # field.

If the string representation is shorter than the length of the specifier, then it is left
aligned.

For example, StrSubstNo('Test %1 >#2##< >#3<', 1,2,3) returns "Test 1 >2   < >3 <".

In this example, the following substitutions are made:

```
%1 is replaced by '1' because a % field is replaced by the specified value in its full
length.
```
```
'#2##' is replaced by '2 space space space' because the value is shorter than the
field and therefore, the 2 is left aligned and the field is four characters long.
```
```
#3 is replaced by '3 space' because the 3 is left aligned and the field is two
characters long
```
If the string is longer, then asterisks are inserted to indicate overflow.

For example, StrSubstNo('Test %1 >###2< >#3<', 'Thomas','Thomas',0) returns "Test
Thomas >****< >0 <".

In this example the following substitutions are made:

```
%1 is replaced by 'Thomas' because a %1 field is replaced by the specified value in
its full length.
```
```
'###2' is replaced by '****' because the string 'Thomas' is longer than the ###2
field. Each character in the field is replaced by an asterisk.
```
```
#3 is replaced by '0 space' because the 0 is left aligned and the field is two
characters long.
```
You can have several references to the same value.


For example, StrSubstNo('Test %1 %3 %1', 555, 666, 777) returns "Test 555 777 555".

If one of the values is null, then it is treated as an empty string.

The following example shows how to use the StrSubstNo method.

```
AL
```
The first message window displays the following text:

**The string before StrSubstNo has been called:**

**The balance of account %1 is $ %2**

The second message window displays the following text:

**The string after StrSubstNo has been called:**

**The balance of account 3452 is $ 7,807**

### Example

```
var
Str: Text[ 1024 ];
AccountNo: Integer;
Balance: Decimal;
Text000: Label 'The balance of account %1 is $ %2';
Text001: Label 'The test string before StrSubstNo is called:\\%1';
Text002: Label 'The string after StrSubstNo is called:\\%1';
begin
Str := Text000;
AccountNo := 3452 ;
Balance := 2345 + 5462 ;
Message(Text001, Str);
Str := StrSubstNo(Str, AccountNo, Balance);
Message(Text002, Str);
end;

Method name Description
ToText(Integer, Integer) Converts the value of a substring of this TextBuilder instance to a
Text.
```
The **TextBuilder** data type is one-based indexed, that is, the indexing begins with 1.

The Text Data Type is a value type, such that every time you use a method on it, you
create a new string object in memory. This requires a new allocation of space. In
situations where you need to perform repeated modifications to a string, the overhead
associated with creating a Text Data Type can be costly.

The **TextBuilder** data type is a reference type, which holds a pointer elsewhere in
memory. For performance reasons, we recommend you to use it when you want to
modify a string without creating a new object. For example, using **TextBuilder** data type
can boost performance when concatenating many strings together in a loop.

Microsoft SQL Server stores information about both date and time in columns of the
datetime type. Business Central uses only the time part and inserts a constant value for
the date: 01-01-1754.

The Business Central undefined time is represented by the same value as an undefined
date. The undefined date is represented by the earliest valid datetime in SQL Server,
which is 01-01-1753 00:00:00:000.

The comparison of time values doesn't work if you compare the time value before
writing to the database with the time value that was written to the database. The cause
of the problem is that in Business Central DateTime and Time values are rounded by
SQL Server (see datetime in Transact-SQL). This means that a DateTime or Time value
can change just because it was written to the database, and the comparison with the
original value then runs on error.

For comparison of two time values, a procedure like the following should be used:

```
AL
```
### SQL Server

### Comparing time values

```
procedure CompareTime(TimeA: Time; TimeB: Time): Integer
begin
// Compares the specified Time values for equality within a small
threshold.
// Returns 1 if TimeA > TimeB, -1 if TimeB > TimeA, and 0 if they are
equal.
```
```
// The threshold must be used to compensate for the varying levels of
precision
// when storing DateTime values. An example of this is the T-SQL
```

# Method attributes

Article•10/01/2024

An attribute is a modifier on a method declaration that specifies information that
controls the method's use and behavior. Adding an attribute on a method declaration is
also known as _decorating_ a method. For example, decorating a method with the
Integration attribute sets the method to be an event publisher. An attribute can have

one or more arguments that set properties for the method instance.

In AL, attributes are placed before the method, and they have the following syntax:

```
AL
```
For example, the Integration attribute has two arguments, and the syntax is:

```
AL
```
AL method reference

```
[Attribute_Name(ArgumentName : data_type, ArgumentName : data_type)]
```
```
[Integration(IncludeSender : Boolean, GlobalVarAccess : Boolean)]
```
```
 Tip
```
```
If you already know the name of, for example, a data type, method, property, or
trigger, use the Filter by title field in the upper left corner, above the table of
contents to find the topic faster. Otherwise, you can scan the table of contents to
find it.

# BusinessEvent attribute

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Specifies that the method is published as a business type event.

```
Method
```
```
AL
```
_IncludeSender_
Type: Boolean
Specifies that the firing instance of the object is available as a parameter to subscribers
of that event.

_[Optional] Isolated_
Type: Boolean
Specifies if event subscribers should be invoked in an isolated transaction.

Typing the shortcut teventbus will create the basic BusinessEvent attribute syntax when

using the AL Language extension for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central in Visual
Studio Code.

For more information about the different event types, see Event Types.

## Applies to

## Syntax

```
[BusinessEvent(IncludeSender: Boolean [, Isolated: Boolean])]
```
## Arguments

## Snippet support

## Remarks


When you set the _IncludeSender_ argument to **true** , the signature of event subscriber
methods that subscribe to the published event automatically include a VAR parameter
for the published event object, as shown in the following example:

```
AL
```
For more information about isolated events, see Isolated Events.

This example publishes a business type event by using the OnAddressLineChanged
method. The method takes a single text data type parameter. The IncludeSender
argument is set to **false**.

# CommitBehavior attribute

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 6.0.
```
Specifies the behavior of a commit call inside the method scope.

```
Method
```
```
AL
```
_Behavior_
Type: CommitBehavior
Specifies if a commit must be ignored or throw an error. The options are: Ignored or
Error.

```
It's only possible to assign a more restrictive commit behavior. That is, if
CommitBehavior::Ignore is attempted on a method scope, but the method calling
the current method, for example, the parent method is actually running with
CommitBehavior::Error, then the current method will continue running with
CommitBehavior::Error, even though the Ignore attribute was specified.
```
```
The CommitBehavior only lasts for the method scope. Regardless of whether the
method finishes successfully or if an error causes the method to exit prematurely,
the CommitBehavior reverts to the standard behavior, where commit statements will
commit to the database.
```
## Applies to

## Syntax

```
[CommitBehavior(Behavior: CommitBehavior)]
```
## Arguments

## Remarks


```
The CommitBehavior only applies to explicit commits, not implicit commits done as
part of Codeunit.Run.
```
The example shown below illustrates how the attribute is used on a local method; it can
also be applied on a global method.

```
AL
```
This example illustrates how you can protect your code from commits happening in
event subscriber code; typically written by a third party.

### Example - local method

```
codeunit 50100 MyCodeunit
{
trigger OnRun()
var
begin
FunctionAllowCommit();
end;
local procedure FunctionAllowCommit()
begin
FunctionIgnoreCommit();
commit; // This is valid, and commit call will be executed.
end;
```
```
[CommitBehavior(CommitBehavior::Ignore)]
local procedure FunctionIgnoreCommit()
begin
TryFunctionErrorCommit();
commit; // This call will be silently ignored.
end;
[CommitBehavior(CommitBehavior::Error)]
[TryFunction]
local procedure TryFunctionErrorCommit()
begin
commit; // This will throw an error. No further code will be
executed and the user will see a dialog to contact the system administrator.
end;

AL
```
_ObjectType_
Type: ObjectType
Specifies the type of object that publishes the event to subscribe to.

_ObjectId_
Type: Integer
Specifies the ID of the object that that publishes the event to subscribe to. You can
specify the object by its ID (integer) or by its name using the syntax <ObjectType>::

<ObjectName>, such as Codeunit::MyEventPublisher. Using the name is the

recommended way.

_EventName_
Type: Text

## Applies to

```
７ Note
```
```
The EventSubscriber attribute can only be set inside codeunits.
```
## Syntax

```
[EventSubscriber(ObjectType: ObjectType, ObjectId: Integer, EventName: Text,
ElementName: Text, SkipOnMissingLicense: Boolean, SkipOnMissingPermission:
Boolean)]
```
## Arguments


Specifies the name of method that publishes the event in the object that is specified by
the ObjectId parameter.

_ElementName_
Type: Text
Specifies the table field that the trigger event pertains to. This argument only requires a
value for database trigger events, that is, when the _ObjectType_ is set to **table** and the
_EventName_ argument is a validate trigger event, such as OnAfterValidateEvent.

_SkipOnMissingLicense_
Type: Boolean
Specifies what happens to the event subscriber method call when the Dynamics 365
Business Central license of the user account that is running the current session does not
include the codeunit that contains the subscriber method.

_SkipOnMissingPermission_
Type: Boolean
Specifies what happens to the subscriber method call when the user account that is
running the current session does not have permission to the codeunit that contains the
event subscriber method.

The value of the _ObjectType_ argument will depend on the type of event: business,
integration, and trigger.

```
Business and integration events are published by event publisher methods in any
of the valid object types. To subscribe to a business or integration type event, you
specify the object that contains the event publisher method that defines the event.
```
```
Trigger events are system events that are automatically declared and published in
table and page object. To subscribe to a trigger event, you specify the Table or
Page, depending on where the trigger published from.
```
### Remarks

```
 Tip
```
```
Use the Shift+Alt+E** shortcut in the AL code editor to invoke the list of all
business , integration , and internal events. Select the one you want to subscribe to
and an event subscriber for the event will be inserted.
```
```
） Important
```

For the _SkipOnMissingLicense_ and _SkipOnMissingPermission_ arguments, **True** will ignore
the method call, and the code execution will continue to the next subscriber; **false** will
throw an error and the code execution stops. **false** is the default.

This example publishes an integration type event by using the **OnAddressLineChanged**
method. The method takes a single text data type parameter. The _IncludeSender_ and
_GlobalVarAccess_ arguments are set to **false**.

```
AL
```
In this example, the **OnAfterValidateLocationCodePurchase** method is subscribed to an
OnAfterValidateEvent (Table) Trigger Event. Therefore, it's run after a field in the
"Purchase Line" table is validated, after its value has been changed.

```
AL
```
```
If the ObjectType is set to Table, you speficy ObjectId by its name using the syntax
Database::<ObjectName>, instead of Table::<ObjectName>.
```
### Example 1

```
codeunit 50105 MyEventPublisher
{
[IntegrationEvent(false, false)]
procedure OnAddressLineChanged(line : Text[ 100 ])
begin
end;
}
```
```
codeunit 50106 MyEventSubscriber

the code that is being tested. In these instances, the test method calls the handler
method, which is run instead of the user interface.

The following is some important information about handler methods:

```
To be a handler method, the method must have set to one of the attributes:
MessageHandler
ConfirmHandler
StrMenuHandler
PageHandler
ModalPageHandler
ReportHandler
RequestPageHandler
SendNotificationHandler
HyperLinkHandler
RecallNotificationHandler
SessionSettingsHandler
FilterPageHandler
```
```
A test method can only call handler methods that are defined in the same test
codeunit as the test method.
```
```
A test method can call MessageHandler , ConfirmHandler , and StrMenuHandler
type handlers only once. It can call PageHandler , ModalPageHandler ,
ReportHandler , RequestPageHandler , or FilterPageHandler type handlers multiple
times but only once per application object ID.
```
```
Every handler method that you enter in the HandlerFunctions attribute must be
called at least once in the test method. If you execute a test method that has a
handler method listed that is not called, then the test fails.
```

## Snippet support


Visual Studio Code.

When you set the _IncludeSender_ argument to **true** , the signature of event subscriber
methods that subscribe to the published event automatically supports a sender
parameter for the published event object, which you must add manually (see the
example).

When you set the _GlobalVarAccess_ argument to **true** , event subscriber methods that
subscribe to the event can call the global variable parameters in the object that declares
the event publisher method. You must add variable parameters to the event subscriber
method signatures manually and use a name and type that matches the variable
declaration in the event publisher object (see the example).

For more information about the different event types, see Event Types.

For more information about isolated events, see Isolated Events.

This example publishes an integration type event by using the OnAddressLineChanged
method. The method takes a single text data type parameter.

The IncludeSender and GlobalVarAccess arguments are set to **true**. This means that the

signature of event subscriber method SubcribeToOnAddressLineChangedEvent includes:

```
The sender parameter for event publishing codeunit MyPublishingCodeunit.
A parameter for the global variable myGlobalVar defined in the publishing codeunit
MyPublishingCodeunit.
```
```
AL
```
### Remarks

```
） Important
```
```
Using GlobalVarAccess will throw a compiler warning, which will become an error in
a future release. Instead use the event parameters or mark the page or table
variables as protected. For more information, see Protected Variables.

The **StrMenuHandler** method is called when a StrMenu method is invoked in code.

You use handler methods to automate tests by handling instances when user interaction
is required by the code that is being tested by the test method. In these instances, the
handler method is run instead of the requested user interface. The handler method
should simulate the user interaction for the test case, such as validating messages,
making selections, or entering values. You declare a handler type attribute on the
method. For more information about handler methods, see Create Handler Methods.

# TransactionModel attribute

```
_TransactionModel_
Type: TransactionModel
The test transaction model used in the test method.

To create meaningful tests, you must first understand how transactions run. In a typical
user scenario, a user who's logged on to a client enters data into one field of a page.
Then the user enters some data in another field on the page. The user also checks the
value of a third field. Finally, the user saves and closes the page. Every time a user enters
data into a field, AL code may be triggered and a new transaction is automatically
started. The trigger code runs within this new transaction. Field data is sent to the server

where it is processed and often updated in the database. When the AL code in the
trigger is finished, the transaction is automatically committed to the database and the
page is refreshed with updated data.

When you create test methods that exercise pages that interact with the database, you
have the following options for simulating user scenarios and then returning the
database to its initial, well-known state:

```
Set the TransactionModel property on the test method to AutoRollback. This
assumes that the code that you test does not include calls to the COMMIT Method.
Any calls to the COMMIT Method give you an error. Most business logic does not
call the COMMIT Method, but relies on implicit commits at the end of the
outermost AL trigger. The test proceeds as follows:
```
1. The test method starts a transaction.
2. The test method initializes data in the database. Database changes are made
    in the transaction that was started by the test method.
3. Fields on the test page are set or updated. Database changes are made in the
    transaction that was started by the test method.
4. The test method reads the values of fields on the test page or reads from the
    database to validate the test.
5. After the test method is completed, the transaction is rolled back and the
    database is returned to its initial state.

```
If the code that you test includes calls to the COMMIT Method, then set the
TransactionModel property on the test method to AutoCommit. The test proceeds
as follows:
```
1. The test method starts a transaction.
2. The test method initializes data in the database. Database changes are made
    in the transaction that was started by the test method.
3. Fields on the test page are set or updated. Database changes are made in the
    transaction that was started by the test method.
4. When the COMMIT method is called, changes are committed to the
    database.
5. The test method reads the values of fields on the test page or reads from the
    database to validate the test.


#### Feedback

6. After the test method is completed, changes are committed to the database.
    To return the database to its initial state, either you must manually revert the
    changes by deleting, updating, or inserting records, or you must use the
    TestIsolation Property on the test runner codeunit to roll back changes.

```
Set the TransactionModel property on the test method to None to simulate the
behavior of an actual user. The test method does not start a transaction and
cannot write to the database. However, a new transaction is started every time that
a field on the page is updated and AL code is triggered. At the end of each trigger,
changes are automatically committed to the database. You can use this option if
your test does not write to the database and you do not have to initialize data in
the database before the test starts. For example, use this option for tests that
validate calculation formulas or tests that read from the database. The test
proceeds as follows:
```
1. If a field on the test page is set or updated and AL code is triggered, then the
    test page starts a transaction. At the end of the trigger, changes are
    committed to the database.
2. The test method validates the test.
3. After the test is completed, no transactions are rolled back. To return the
    database to its initial state, either you must manually revert the changes by
    deleting, updating, or inserting records, or you must use the TestIsolation
    Property on the test runner codeunit to roll back changes.

With **AutoCommit** and **AutoRollback** , the test method starts a write transaction.
Triggers that are invoked by the test code inherit this open transaction instead of
running in their own separate transactions. By using the **AutoCommit** and **AutoRollback**
settings, if several page interactions are invoked from test code, then they share the
same transaction. By using the **None** setting, each page interaction runs in a separate
transaction.

execution. For example, with try methods, you can provide more user-friendly error
messages to the end user than those thrown by the system. You can use try methods to
catch errors/exceptions that are thrown by Business Central or exceptions that are
thrown during .NET Framework interoperability operations.

# Properties overview

Article•10/01/2024

This section describes the properties that are available to developers in Business Central
for controlling the behavior of objects, like tables, pages, and reports.

There are different properties for various AL object types. Some properties can be set on
the object-level, and others pertain to specific controls of the object. Properties are
added at the beginning of the code for the object or control, after the its definition, by
using the syntax: Property_name = value;. For example:

```
If you already know the name of, for example, a data type, method, property, or
trigger, use the Filter by title field in the upper left corner, above the table of
contents to find the topic faster. Otherwise, you can scan the table of contents to
find it.
```
```

{
// Page object properties
PageType = Card;
ApplicationArea = All;
UsageCategory = Administration;
SourceTable = Customer;

Accepts a text value and supports a rich text value such as **bold** and *italic*.

```
When setting this property, you must also set the AboutTitle property. Both About
properties must be specified for the teaching tip to appear.
```
```
The property is ignored at runtime if the current client isn't the Web client.
```
```
When setting this property on page objects:
```
```
The page teaching tip isn't displayed if the page has PageType set to
RoleCenter, NavigatePage, ConfirmationDialog, StandardDialog, or
HeadlinePart.
```
```
Enable UICop rule AW0012 to prevent this at compile-time.
```
## Applies to

## Property Value

## Remarks


```
The page teaching tip isn't displayed automatically if the page is run in lookup
mode, but it can still be reached from the page caption. Examples include pages
run as an advanced lookup, and pages run with LookupMode set to true.
```
```
When setting this property on page controls:
The control teaching tip isn't shown if the control has a Visible property that
evaluates to false.
The control teaching tip is displayed for field controls only if they represent
repeater fields or fields in the content area of the page. It isn't displayed for
other uses of field controls, such as cues.
The control teaching tip is displayed for actions and action groups on the
primary page and sub forms. It isn't displayed for other uses of actions, such as
actions displayed in context menus, action tiles, actions displayed in the footer
of a NavigatePage, RoleCenter navigation menus, or actions displayed in the
menu for a record in a list.
If the page object is a part that is embedded on the hosting page or in a
FactBox, the control teaching tip becomes part of the tour on the hosting page.
If the part is hosted on a Role Center, then the teaching tip isn't displayed.
```

# Access Property

Article•08/26/2024

other code in your module or other modules.

```
Public The object can be accessed by any other code in the same module and in other

###### Codeunits

```
codeunit 50113 MyCodeunit
{
Access = Internal;
...
```
### Remarks

```
） Important
```
```
This property is only taken into consideration at compile time. For example, at
compile time, a table with Access = Internal cannot be used from other modules
that do not have access to the internals of the module where the table is defined,
but at runtime, any module can access the table by using reflection-based
mechanisms such as RecordRef, or TransferFields. And the OnRun trigger can be
run on internal codeunits by using Codeunit.Run. Setting the object accessibility
level as Access = Internal; cannot be used as a security boundary. Also see JSON
Files.
```
```
７ Note
```
```
The accessibility of tables and table fields is taken into account when using
Designer. As a consequence, only table fields which have their accessibility set to
Public can be added to the page.

# AccessByPermission Property

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Sets a value for a table field or UI element that determines the permission mask for an
object that a user must have to see and access the related page fields or UI element in
the client. The UI element will be removed at runtime if the user does not have
permissions to a certain object as specified in the AccessByPermission property.

All types of UI elements will be removed if they relate to an object to which the user
does not have the required permissions:

```
Fields on pages, including FactBoxes
```
```
Actions on pages, including ToolBars and navigation panes
```
```
Page parts, such as Lines FastTabs
```
```
Table field
Page Field
Page Part
Page System Part
Page Chart Part
Page Action
Page Custom Action
Page File Upload Action
Page
Report
```
## Applies to

```
） Important
```
```
If the AccessByPermission property is applied to a page field from a virtual table,
this property is ignored. This means that users will see this field on the page in the
client even if they do not have the permissions that are required by this property.
```
```
７ Note
```

The **AccessByPermission** property values are as described below:

```
Values Represents Description
R Read Specify if Read permission is required to display the UI element.
```
```
I Insert Specify if Insert permission is required to display the UI element.
M Modify Specify if Modify permission is required to display the UI element.
```
```
D Delete Specify if Delete permission is required to display the UI element.
X Execute Specify if Execute permission is required to display the UI element.
```
```
AL
```
The property value for TableData can be set with a combination of **Read** , **Insert** , **Modify**
and **Delete** permissions. This means, you can set the property value to RIMD

A text string that contains a comma-separated list of application area tags.

An application area tag must have the format _name_ , where _name_ is the application area.
The _name_ can be any combination of letters (Aa-Zz) and numbers (0-9) without spaces.
For example, to specify the **Basic** and **Fixed Assets** application areas, set the property to
**Basic, FixedAssets**.

If the control applies to all application areas, you can set the property to **All**. This means
that the control will always appear in the user interface.

```
AL
```
## Applies to

## Property Values

## Syntax

```
ApplicationArea = Basic, Suite;
```

```
APPLIES TO: Business Central 2022 release wave 2 and later
```
With Business Central 2022 release wave 2, the ApplicationArea property set on fields

defaults to the page value. The property inheritance means that page controls without
the ApplicationArea property explicitly set, inherit the ApplicationArea _defined on the_

_parent page_ or _report if it's a request page_. The ApplicationArea property can be used

without setting the UsageCategory property on pages to provide a default fallback for
controls, without forcing search visibility.

Application areas represent a feature in the system that offers developers,
administrators, and users the ability to define differentiated user experiences. They are
mapped to controls to show or hide them on page objects to enable more or fewer
business scenarios.

The **ApplicationArea** property is used together with the ApplicationArea method to hide
user interface elements.

If one or more application areas are enabled in a session, any controls that are not
tagged with an application area will not appear in the user interface.

You can also add new application areas, see Extending Application Areas for more
information.

### Remarks

```
 Tip
```
```
With Business Central 2023 release wave 1, a new code action is introduced to set
the default value for ApplicationArea on a page or a report level and remove all
duplicates on field level. This code action can be applied to an object, a document,
a project, or a workspace. For more information, see AL Code Actions.
```
```

The ApplicationArea property inheritance has no impact on page or report
extensions. On these extensions values must still be set explicitly.

If several transactions are performed at the same time, they will each be assigned a
different number. However, if one of these transactions is rolled back, the number
that it was assigned is not reused.

If you add an auto-increment field to an existing table, the field automatically generates
consecutive values and inserts them into the table. If you enable the AutoIncrement
property for a field that already contains data, there must be no zero values in the field.

The AutoIncrement property is designed to always assign numbers automatically. If you
want to insert a record, be sure that the value in this field is blank before you insert the
record.

The AutoIncrement property does not work with Dynamics 365 Business Central

**True** if the record is written to the table automatically; otherwise, **false**. The default value

```
This property applies to new records that are inserted into the table and existing records
that are modified.

If AutoSave is set to **false** , then an imported record is not automatically written to the
appropriate table. To insert or modify records manually, add code to the
OnBeforeInsertRecord Trigger and the OnBeforeModifyRecord Trigger. For example, set
the AutoSave property to **false** , create a new method that evaluates the records, does
some calculations, or retrieves additional data, and then call your new method from the
OnBeforeInsertRecord and OnBeforeModifyRecord triggers. Use the OnAfterInitRecord
trigger if you must evaluate the records before inserting or modifying them, or if you
want to calculate or retrieve additional data before inserting or modifying the record.

If a record already exists and AutoSave is set to **true** , then the values of the AutoReplace
Property and the AutoUpdate Property determine whether the imported record

# CaptionClass Property

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Controls the caption that is used in the label of a field in a database table or in the label
of a control on a page.

```
Table field
Page Label
Page Field
```
```
AL
```
The CaptionClass property must be expressed in the format '<Caption Area>, <Caption

Expression>'. Both <Caption Area> and <Caption Expression> are alphanumeric strings.

When you set the **CaptionClass property** on a field, users can configure the caption of a
text box or the caption of a check box without having to modify the code. The Caption
Class (codeunit 42) in the system application layer then translates the CaptionClass

property into actual captions that will be displayed in the UI. For example, if
CaptionClass = '3, My awesome caption'; the resulting caption in the UI will be **My**

**awesome caption**.

## Applies to

## Syntax

```
CaptionClass = '3, My awesome caption';
```
## Remarks

```
７ Note
```
```
<Caption Area> is the location of the caption you want to use. The <Caption Area>
can be '50000', '50140', and so on. Or, it can be a code from among 1, 2, and 3,
which are handled by the base application layer and have a special meaning.
```

The Caption Class (codeunit 42) in the system application exposes two events; the

```
OnResolveCaptionClass and the OnAfterCaptionClassResolve event.
```
For more information, see the system Caption Class.

The Caption Class raises an OnResolveCaptionClass event for any other value of <Caption

Area>.

```
AL
```
The OnAfterCaptionClassResolve event is used to overwrite the above logic, in case the

```
CaptionClass property isn't the expected format or if some extra logic needs to be
```
added.

```
AL
```
```
1 is for using a Dimension as caption.
2 is for captions of fields that can include or not VAT. For example, if
CaptionClass = '2,0,Invoice Amount'; the resulting caption in the UI will be
Invoice Amount Excl. VAT. If CaptionClass = '2,1,Invoice Amount'; the
resulting caption in the UI will be Invoice Amount Incl. VAT.
3 returns the <Caption Expression> string. In the example in the above
section, "3" returns the <Caption Expression> that is My awesome caption.
```
```
） Important
```
```
If you omit the pattern of '<Caption Area>, <Caption Expression>', the caption
becomes the value of whatever string has been given to the CaptionClass property.
This means that you can use an expression such as CaptionClass =
ItemRec.Fieldcaption("Location Code"); as long as the returned data type is Text.
```
###### Caption Class

```
[IntegrationEvent(false, false)]
internal procedure OnResolveCaptionClass(CaptionArea: Text; CaptionExpr:
Text; Language: Integer; var Caption: Text; var Resolved: Boolean)
begin
end;

The CaptionML property is multilanguage enabled, so it can contain a list of text strings
in different languages. The string that is used is selected according to the user's
language settings. For more information, see Working with Translation Files.

The CaptionML property has the following format.

```
<Language ID>='<caption>'
```
```
<Language ID> is the standard Windows three-letter language ID, and <caption> is the
```
caption text for this language. Use commas to separate entries.

The following example shows a CaptionML value.

```
CaptionML = DEU='Name',DAN='Navn',ESP='Nombre',FRA='Nom',ENC='Name';
```
In this example, values are set for Danish (DAN), German Standard (DEU), Spanish
Traditional Sort (ESP), French Standard (FRA), and English Canadian (ENC).

When the CaptionML property does not include an entry for the language used in the
client at runtime, then a default value for the caption string will be used according to

### Syntax

```
CaptionML = ENU= 'Name',DAN='Navn',ESP='Nombre',FRA='Nom',ENC='Name';

Sets the range of characters the user can enter into this field or control.

```
Table field
Page Field
```
```
AL
```
If you want users to only enter uppercase letters in this field, enter **AZ**. This ensures that
only uppercase characters in the range of A-Z are accepted. If you want both uppercase
and lowercase characters, leave this value blank.

You can specify multiple ranges of characters by entering the parameters in pairs. For
example, a value of **admpzz** indicates that only the following characters are accepted: a,
b, c, d, m, n, o, p, and z. If you only want to allow a single character, then enter that
character twice to specify a starting and ending range.

The setting for the field is checked during validation. Validation occurs only if the field or
control value is updated through the UI, for example, if a value is updated on a page or
if a field is updated in a table directly. If a field is updated through application code,
then the **CharAllowed** property is not validated.

# ColumnFilter Property

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Sets a filter on the column filter row of a query.

```
Query Column
Query Filter
```
Filter expression.

The filter expression must follow the required syntax. For more information, see Entering
Criteria in Filters.

In a query, Columns and Filter rows specify fields of the underlying table of the parent
DataItem. Columns appear in the resulting dataset, whereas Filter rows do not. You use a
ColumnFilter property to apply a condition on a field to limit the records in query’s
resulting dataset. The ColumnFilter property resembles the DataItemTableFilter Property
of the DataItem, but there are differences. The ColumnFilter property has the following
behavior:

```
Unlike filters that are set by the DataItemTableFilter property, filters that are set by
the ColumnFilter property can be overwritten at runtime by calling the SetFilter
Method (Query) and SetRange Method (Query) from AL code.
```
```
There can be multiple calls to the SetFilter and SetRange methods in AL, but it is
the first call in the method that overwrites the ColumnFilter property.
```
```
If the ColumnFilter property specifies a filter on the same field as the
DataItemTableFilter property, then the filters of the two properties are combined.
In SQL SELECT statements, this combination corresponds to an AND operator. To
be included in the query dataset, records must meet the condition of both the
filters. For example, if the DataItemTableFilter property sets a filter on a field to
```

## Property Value

## Remarks

```
include values less than fifty (<50) and the ColumnFilter property sets a filter on
the same field to include values greater than twenty (>20), then the resultant filter
on the field includes values that are greater than twenty and less than fifty (20<
value <50). However, if the same field is also set with a filter from AL code by
calling the SetFilter or SetRange methods, then only the DataItemTableFilter
property filter is applied because, even though the method overwrites the
ColumnFilter property filter, the method filter is ignored.
```
```
You can set the ColumnFilter property on any Column or Filter row in the query,
this includes columns that are set with the totaling method using the Method
Property.
```
```
In an SQL SELECT statement, a filter that is set by the ColumnFilter property that is
not applied a totaling method would correspond to a WHERE clause. A filter on a
column that is applied a totaling method would correspond to a HAVING clause.
```
The following example sets a filter on the ColumnFilter property of the Quantity column
of a query so that the resulting dataset will only include records where the value of the
Quantity column is between 20 and 50.

```

## Syntax

## Remarks


improve performance when viewing objects. **ReadOnly** works as a hint for the server to
route the connection to a secondary (read-only) replica, if one is available. When a
workload is executed against the replica, insert/delete/modify operations aren't
possible. If any of these operations are executed against the replica, an exception is
thrown at runtime. The following sections explain how this property is handled on
different object types.

The property only applies to pages of type API. The Editable property must be set to
**false**. When an OData call fetches data from the page, then it's only the call to fetch the
data that uses the read-only replica. Database calls needed in setting up the API page
are performed against the primary database, for example, database calls in the
OpenCompany triggers.

The property only has an effect on queries exposed through OData (API queries). It has
no effect in normal code paths. When an OData call fetches data from the query, then
it's only the call to actually fetch the data that uses the read-only replica. Database calls
needed in setting up the session before retrieving data are performed against the
primary database, for example, database calls in the OpenCompany triggers.

The property also affects reports generated in UI sessions. The database calls needed
while iterating through data items use the read-only replica if it's set. Records read
before and after generation of the data set are read from the primary database.

From the client, the property value can be overwritten by using page **9880 Database
Access Intent List** page.

When calling an API page or API query, the property value can be overwritten by
specifying HTTP request header Data-Access-Intent.

###### Page

###### Query

###### Report

```
７ Note
```
```
Setting the DataAccessIntent property to ReadOnly doesn't guarantee that your
data access will be running on the secondary replica. It's merely stating that the
code only requires read ability, so a read-only connection can be used.

For example, the property doesn't apply to queries running at arbitrary times

There is a table relation (as defined by the TableRelation Property) on one or
more of the fields. In this case, the DataCaptionFields from the underlying table
are used. If this table does not have a value for the DataCaptionFields property,
the primary key for that table is used.
```
```
There is no table relation. In this case, the (single) value that results from
evaluating the filter is used directly.
```
The following is an example of how the DataCaptionFields property is used. The
Customer Card page (21) is based on the Customer table (18). Using the **Navigate** menu
on this page, users can open other pages, including the Customer Ledger Entry page
(25).

In the Customer table, the DataCaptionFields property is set to **No., Name**. On the
Customer Ledger Entry page, the DataCaptionFields property is set to **CustomerNo.**.
When the Customer Ledger Entry page (25) is opened from the Customer Card page
(21), a filter is set on Customer No. field of the Customer Ledger Entries table, selecting
only those entries related to the currently displayed customer on the Customer Card.
This relationship is accomplished by setting the **RunPageLink** property of the menu item
that invokes the Customer Ledger Entry page to Customer No.=FIELD(No.).

If you view the Customer Ledger Entry page with a filter applied, the customer name
and number appear to the left of the caption on the Customer Ledger Entry page. If you
remove the filter, the caption disappears.

The important point is that the DataCaptionFields property on a page does not directly
put any caption on the page, but only works when used with appropriate settings of
DataCaptionFields at the table level.

Sets filters on fields of the underlying table of a query.

```

```
Filter expression.

The filter expression must follow the required syntax. For more information, see Entering
Criteria in Filters.

```
AL
```
In a query, a DataItem specifies a table from which to retrieve data. You use the
DataItemTableFilter property to apply conditions on one or more fields of the table to
limit the records in the resulting dataset of the query. You can filter on any field in the
table, not just those fields that are included as columns in the resulting dataset.

In addition to the **DataItemTableFilter** property, you can also filter on the same field by
setting the ColumnFilter Property on a column or filter row or by calling the SetFilter
Method (Query) and SetRange Method (Query) from AL. A filter that is set by the
ColumnFilter property, **SetFilter** method, or **SetRange** method is joined to the filter that
is set by the DataItemTableFilter property. In logical terms, and in SQL SELECT
statements, this combination corresponds to an "AND" operator. For example, if the
DataItemTableFilter property sets a filter on a field to include values less than fifty (<50)

## Applies to

## Property Value

## Syntax

```
DataItemTableFilter = "Document Type" = filter (Invoice | "Credit Memo");
```
## Remarks


and the **ColumnFilter** property sets a filter on the same field to include values greater
than twenty (>20), then the resultant filter includes values that are greater than twenty
and less than fifty (20< value <50). Using the same example, if the **SetFilter** method is
called from AL code and sets a filter to include values greater than ten (>10), then the
**SetFilter** method overwrites the **ColumnFilter** property and the resultant filter on the
field includes values that are greater than ten and less than fifty (10< value <50).

The following example shows how to use the **DataItemTableFilter** property to filter the
data of the Item table, used in the "Low on stock inventory items" query.

The **DataItemTableFilter** property filters on those records that are physical inventory
items (Type = CONST(Inventory)), that have less than 20 units in stock (Inventory =

filter(<= 20)) and for which no substitute item exists ("Substitutes Exist" =
const(false)).

```
AL
```
```
７ Note

In an SQL SELECT statement, a filter that is set by the DataItemTableFilter property
would correspond to a WHERE clause.

{

{
dataitem(item; "Item")
{
DataItemTableFilter = Type = CONST(Inventory), Inventory =

For decimal fields, this property specifies the number of decimal places that you want to
store. The default storage requirements for Decimal Data Type are two decimal places
for amounts. Use this property to specify storage requirements that are different than
the default.

This setting is evaluated on text boxes and fields during validation.

When you create a new field of Decimal Data Type, the value is automatically formatted
as a currency. If your decimal field does not contain a currency value, then you can use
this property to determine the number of decimal places that appear on the screen. For
example, in the G/L Entry table, the DecimalPlaces property of field 42, Quantity, is set to
0:5. The minimum number of decimal places that you can enter is 0 and the maximum is
5.

Adding a new interface to an existing, extensible enum, requires that all extensions of
that enum provide an implementations for the interface, which is a breaking change.
Providing a default implementation by using the DefaultImplementation property can
be used to make such new additions non-breaking.

Related to DefaultImplementation is the UnknownValueImplementation property, used for

# Editable Property

```
**True** on pages if the field, page, or control can be edited; otherwise, **false** on pages. The
default value is **true**.

```
AL
```
For fields, use this property to make a field for display only.

For controls, if the **Editable** property for the container that contains this control is set to
**false** , then that setting overrides what you enter here.

## Applies to

## Property Value

## Syntax

```
Editable = true;
```
## Remarks


If a page has **Editable** set to **false** , then the controls on the page aren't editable, even if
the individual **Editable** properties are set to **true**.

The property setting is checked during validation. Validation occurs only if the field or
control value is updated through the UI. For example, when a value is updated on a
page or when a field is updated in a table. If a field is updated through application code,
then the **Editable** property isn't validated.

On pages, you use the **Editable** property for group, part, field, and action controls. You
can make them editable or non-editable either statically by setting the property to **true**
or **false** , or dynamically by using a Boolean variable or a Boolean field on the page. The
Boolean field on the page can either be a Boolean value true/false or a Boolean
expression. For a page showing the Customer table, an example could be:

```
AL
```
```
７ Note
```
```
When using CurrPage.Editable, the Editable property also reflects the page mode
that the page was opened in. This applies to Edit, Create, and Delete modes, but
not to View mode. If the page not is editable, then CurrPage.Editable will return
false.
```
```
Editable = "Balance Due (LCY)" > "Credit Limit (LCY)"
```
```
Ｕ Caution
```
```
Do not use CurrPage.Editable to prevent users from deleting entries. We
recommend that you use permissions to control which users can delete data.
```
```
７ Note
```
```
You can also use as property value a Boolean variable that evaluates to true or
false. To use a variable for the Editable property, it must be set as a global page
variable.

For keys, this property determines whether any index (normal or SIFT) defined in the key
is created in the database. If you are not using the key or if you rarely use the key, you
may want to mark it as disabled for performance reasons. When you want to use the key
you can change this setting.

For fields, this property determines whether you can store data in the field. If the field is
unused, disable it to conserve database space. In an XMLPort, a disabled field is read
from the external file on import, but it is not inserted in the database.

For controls, the Enabled setting for the container that contains this control overrides
what is entered here.

On pages, you use the **Enabled** property for group, part, field, and action controls. You
can enable or disable the control either statically by setting the property to **true** or **false** ,
or dynamically by using a Boolean variable or a Boolean field on the page. The Boolean
field on the page can be either a true/false Boolean or a Boolean expression, such as
“Credit Limit > Sales YTD”.

# EventSubscriberInstance Property

Article•08/26/2024

instance and the events that they subscribe to.

```

```
**StaticAutomatic** is the default value for this property. The bindings are always
considered static on the event publisher side. For example, if you bind instance _A_ of a
given subscriber codeunit, all instances of publisher application objects will start calling
the event subscribers. You can't design it so that a specific instance of publisher table _X_

## Applies to

## Property value

```
ﾉ Expand table
```
## Syntax

```
EventSubscriberInstance = StaticAutomatic|Manual;
```
## Remarks


calls only a specific instance of subscriber codeunit _A_. You can, however, achieve the
same by using/storing some global state on the subscriber.

If the subscriber codeunit is defined as single instance (as specified by the
SingleInstance Property), the first call to an event subscriber creates in instance of the
codeunit. This instance is kept for the lifespan of the session.

If the codeunit isn't declared as single instance, each event subscriber will be run in its
own codeunit instance. When an event gets raised, a codeunit instance is created for
each event subscriber method that subscribes to the event. The individual codeunit
instances are immediately disposed after its event subscriber is run.

This setting enables you to control which event subscriber instances are called when an
event is raised. With this setting, you can essentially activate event subscribers on
demand. If the **BindSubscription** method isn't called, then nothing will happen when the
event is raised.

The binding of event subscribers to events is manual. To establish the binding, you must
call the **BindSubscription** method to pass an instance of an event subscriber codeunit.
Only then will the event subscribers be called.

You stop the event subscriber calls by either calling the **UnBindSubscription** method or
by letting the previously bound instance go out of scope. For example, you declare a
local variable, call **BindSubscription** , and then eventually exit the method that declares
the local variable. All bindings on the instance are automatically unbound.

By controlling the instance of the subscriber codeunit, you control the lifespan. If you
store the instance on a single instance codeunit global variable, you're effectively
creating a binding that lasts the whole session. However, it's still only bound for the
current session. Other sessions must also call **BindSubscription** to establish the direct
binding to the instance of the subscriber codeunit.

###### StaticAutomatic binding

```
７ Note
```
```
With this setting, you can't call the BindSubscription method or
UnBindSubscription method for any events in this codeunit; otherwise, an error
occurs.
```
###### Manual binding


```
A manually bound event subscriber is stale and will no longer be called. This can
```
be caused by the subscriber object being updated by an operation in the development
environment.

This code example uses the EventSubscriberInstance property to manually bind an event
subscriber to an event. The example uses events to display a message to the user if they
use a '+' sign in the **Address** field on the **Customer Card** page.

The following code creates codeunit that publishes the OnAddressLineChanged event.

```
AL
```
The following code declares the CheckAddressLine event subscriber in the event

subscriber codeunit **50101 MySubscribers**. The event subscriber displays a message in
the client when '+' is used in the **Address** field.

```
AL
```
```
） Important
```
```
When you develop on a production solution, you can experience a runtime error if
the event subscriber codeunit has been updated by a development operation. For
example, you recompiled the codeunit. This situation causes the event subscription
codeunit's metadata to become stale and prevents the event subscriber from being
called. A message similar to the following message appears in the event log:
```
### Example

```
codeunit 50100 MyPublishers
{
[IntegrationEvent(false, false)]
procedure OnAddressLineChanged(line: Text[ 100 ])
begin
end;
}
```
```
codeunit 50101 MySubscribers
{
//Set the event subscribers to manual binding;
EventSubscriberInstance = Manual;
[EventSubscriber(ObjectType::Codeunit, Codeunit::"MyPublishers",
'OnAddressLineChanged', '', true, true)]
procedure CheckAddressLine(line: Text[ 100 ])
```

The following code extends the **Customer Card** page to raise the OnAddressLineChanged
event when the **Address** field is changed:

```
AL
```
On the event publisher side, the bindings are always considered static. For example, if
you bind instance _A_ of a given subscriber codeunit, all instances of publisher application
objects will start calling the event subscribers. You can't design it so that a specific
instance of publisher table _X_ calls only a specific instance of subscriber codeunit _A_.
However, you can achieve the same by using/storing some global state on the
subscriber.

２ Warning
```
```
Using the report properties DefaultLayout , ExcelLayout , RDLCLayout , and
WordLayout should be avoided as these properties will be deprecated in a later
release. Instead, it's recommended to use the property DefaultRenderingLayout
together with the new rendering syntax introduced in runtime version 9.0.

In Visual Studio Code, when hovering over any line with the ExcelLayout ,
RDLLayout , or WordLayout property, you can use the code action Convert to
'Rendering' to convert to the new rendering syntax.

```
The property affects the layout and behavior of controls on a page. Use this, for
example, to display a field as an email address.

By applying special meaning or semantics to a field, the value of the table field is
converted to a text field of the new data type that may apply special validation, a
different way of displaying the value or interacting with the field.

The value of this property on a page control overrides the same property on a table
field.

With Business Central 2023 release wave 2, you can use the RichContent option to
enable a rich text field. To enable a rich text field, the field must have the Multiline
property set to true and it must reside alone within a FastTab group. For an example of

creating a rich text editor, see Creating a rich text editor.

**FieldSeparator** is only used if the **Format** property is set to **Variable Text**. Otherwise, the
setting is ignored.

This property specifies how tables should be separated. The default value is a comma
( **<,>** ).

The strings in the preceding table must be entered literally, using the < and >
characters. These special strings can be combined and can also be mixed with other
characters.

CR refers to the character with ASCII value 13.

LF refers to the character with ASCII value 10.

You can set the field separator in AL code so that the XMLport can import and export
records with different separators. For example, if your XMLport must import from a file
or stream where one record uses commas and another uses **TAB** , you can change the
field separator property at run time.

The **FileName** property must be set to a valid file name or a run-time error occurs.

This property can be set dynamically by using the FILENAME Method (XMLport). Using
this method together with the Import method, you can create XMLports that are
dynamic. This means that they can determine whether data is input or output at run
time, and the name of the external file to read from or write to can also be set at run
time.

If **FileName** is blank, then a default request options page tab will be created, where this
property can be set at run time. If no name is specified or the UseRequestPage Property
is set to **false** , then a run-time error occurs.

If the data that you want to import does not follow either the Standard AL formats or
the XML formats, import the data into a temporary table in text format. You can then
use AL code to convert the data before inserting it into the database.

If you want to export data that uses the standard AL data types to an XML document
and use these data types in the XML document, use AL Format/Evaluate (default value).
The data from the database is then formatted according to the standard rules for AL
data types.

If you want to export data in the standard XML formats to an XML document, use the
XML Format/Evaluate setting. This ensures that the data you export from the database is
formatted and exported in the standard XML formats.

The following XML Data types require evaluation.

Control Add In
```
A list of comma-separated strings that represents paths to image files. The default is
blank, with no images being used by the control add-in.

You can specify multiple files within the same path string by using a combination of a
valid literal path and wildcard characters (* and ?). However, it doesn't support regular
expressions.

The Images property specifies image resources that are referenced by the control add-in
scripts. Any specified images must be of a supported web format and extension, such as
.PNG or .GIF.

Images can be either external resources referenced using a URL or can be embedded
within the extension. Embedded images must be added to the extension project folder
in Visual Studio Code and referenced using a relative path. At runtime, the path to an
embedded can be obtained using the GetImageResource method method. Unlike scripts
and stylesheets, images are loaded on demand when they're first used in code. Since
images are stored in the application after the extension is deployed, it's recommended
to keep the number of image files and combined image size to a minimum.

Starting from runtime 13, you can store control add-in resources in a location relative to
the file that contains the source code of the control add-in. This provides more flexibility
in organizing and locating control add-in resources.

When the system needs to locate these resources, it follows a specific search order; first,
it looks for the resources in a location relative to the root of the project. If the resources
aren't found there, it then searches in a location relative to the source file of the control
add-in.

The following example shows the two options for organizing control add-in resources;
scripts, images, and stylesheets. For the file MyControlAddIn.al, the resources are
organized in two different ways.

For the file MyControlAddIn.al.

```

Images = 'https://fabrikam.com/banner.png',

As a developer, the Importance property can also be set also by Use Designer (see Use

Designer). In the client, users can change the setting for their workspace by using
personalization (see Personalizing Your Workspace.

Properties

```
７ Note
```
```
In version 24 (runtime 14) and earlier, the Importance property is ignored on
StandardDialog and ConfirmationDialog page types. This behavior means that a
field can't be hidden under the Show more action even if the user tries to do so
using personalization or designer. The field also can't be promoted in the header of
a collapsed FastTab. However, starting in version 25 (runtime 15), the property is
fully respected in the client so it behaves the same as it does on any other page
type. As a result, after upgrading to version 25, users might have a slightly different
experience on some StandardDialog and ConfirmationDialog page types.

# IncludeCaption Property

Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Sets whether to include the caption of a field in the data set of a report.

```
Report Column
```
**True** includes the caption in the report dataset; otherwise **false**. The default value is
**false**.

If IncludeCaption is set to **True** on a column in a dataitem, then a corresponding label

called _{column name}Caption_ is included in the dataset. The structure of where labels are
available depends on the layout type (Excel, Word, or RDLC). For more information, see
Report labels.

If you want to use the Caption or CaptionML values of a field as a label on a report
layout, then you must include the caption in the dataset. If you do not include the
caption in the dataset, then in a multilanguage application, you cannot use the
multilanguage captions as labels in the report.

In this example, the report has a dataitem based on the **Item table**. The dataitem has a
column **No_Item** based on the field **No.** from the **Item** table, and the caption of this
column should be included as a label in the report dataset.

The **IndentationControls** property lets you choose which columns are indented under a

This property specifies field in the source table that controls which records are indented
and by how much.

When using this property, consider the following behavior:

```
Web client supports indentation on one column only. You can specify more than
one column, however, in the UI, the columns may not appear as expected.
When indentation is specified, it's no longer possible to use sorting on the
columns in the repeater control.
This property is ignored if the ShowAsTree property on the repeater is set to true.
Right-aligned data in columns, such as the integer data type, won't appear as
indented.

following situations:

In the Customer table, the primary key is the customer number and is stored in the No.

customer number as a foreign key in the field called Sell-to Customer No.

Setting the LinkTable Property of the second XML item to point to the Customer table

# LinkTable Property

Article•08/26/2024

Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.

Sets the table that this XML item should be linked to. This property is only available for
XML items that have a table as their data source.

```
Xml Port Table Element
```
```
AL
```
This property works in combination with the LinkFields Property and the
LinkTableForceInsert Property.

In this example, you are exporting data about specific customers and the orders that
they placed. You create an XMLport based on the following database tables:

```
A Customer table that contains general information about the customer, such as
address, telephone number, and so on.
```
```
A Sales Header table that contains information about the orders placed by these
customers.
```
In the Customer table, the primary key is the customer number and is stored in the No.
field. In the Sales Header table, each record contains this customer number as a foreign
key in the Sell-to Customer No field.

## Applies to

## Syntax

```
LinkTable = <field>;
```
## Remarks

## Exporting


Set the **LinkTable** property of the Sales Header XML item to point to the Customer table
and set the LinkFields Property of the Sales Header XML item so that the Sell-to
Customer No. field is equal to the No. field in the Customer table. This places a filter on
the records in the Customer table and ensures that only those records in the Sales
Header table that refer to the customers you specified are selected and exported by the
XMLport.

This corresponds to placing the following AL code in the OnPreXMLItem Trigger of the
indented data item.

```
AL
```
In this example, you are importing XML data that contains information about new
customers as well as details about their first orders. You create an XMLport based on the
following database tables:

```
A Customer table that contains general information about the customer, such as
address, telephone and so on.
```
```
A Sales Header table that contains information about the orders placed by these
customers.
```
In the Customer table, the primary key is the customer number and is stored in the No.
field. In the Sales Header table, each record contains this customer number as a foreign
key in the field called Sell-to Customer No.

You must set the **LinkTable** property of the Sales Header XML item to point to the
Customer table and set the LinkFields Property of the Sales Header XML item so that the
Sell-to Customer No. field points to the No. field in the Customer table. This ensures
that the customer numbers in the incoming data stream are inserted into both the
Customer table and the Sales Header table. The incoming data stream must conform to
the XML schema that you have defined for your XMLport.

In this example, the information you are importing has a header/line relationship—each
customer can place many orders. The customer information is the parent of the sales
header information. In this kind of relationship the parent information generally
methods as a kind of wrapper that encapsulates the information about the children.

```
SetRange("Sell-to Customer No.",Customer."No.");
```
### Importing


#### Feedback

**Was this page helpful?**

Provide product feedback

The schema typically starts by supplying some of the parent information, followed by
the information about the children, and it finishes by supplying the last of the parent
information.

When the XML stream is processed, it begins with the parent information, for example,
the customer number is inserted into the No. field in the Customer table. Next comes
the sales header information and the customer number is inserted into the Sell-to
Customer No. field in the Sales Header table. The rest of the sales header information is
then inserted into that table.

In this case, you must use the LinkTableForceInsert Property to ensure that the parent
information is inserted before the child information. The customer information is
inserted into the Customer table before you start processing the sales header
information. This makes it possible to validate the sales header information against the
customer information as it is inserted.

After the sales header information has been processed, the last of the customer
information is inserted into the Customer table.

If the customer number already exists, you will receive an error. This means that you will
probably have to insert the data into a temporary table, modify it, and then insert it into
the correct tables.

# LinkTableForceInsert Property

This property works in combination with the LinkFields Property and the LinkTable
Property.

Setting this property to **true** will forcibly insert or modify data from the linked table and
run the OnAfterInitRecord Trigger on the main table.

This feature is useful if you have a header to line relationship in your XML document.
The table and the header information must be inserted before you can insert the line
information. As a result, you can use this property to ensure that the header information
is inserted before the XMLport starts reading the line information.

```
SumIndexFields are created in Dynamics 365 Business Central to support FlowField
calculations and other fast summing operations. SQL Server can sum numeric data by
scanning the table. If the SIFT structures exist for the SumIndexFields, summing the
fields is faster, especially for large sets of records, but modifications to the table are
slower because the SIFT structures must also be maintained.

In situations where SumIndexFields must be created on a key to enable FlowField
calculations, but the calculations are performed infrequently or on small sets of data,
you can disable this property to prevent slow modifications to the table.

```
AL
```
In Dynamics 365 Business Central, you can use a key to sort data in a table by the set of
fields specified in the key. SQL Server can sort data without an index on the fields to be
sorted. However, if an index exists, sorting by the fields matching the index will be faster,
but modifications to the table will be slower. The more indexes there are on a table, the
slower the modifications become.

In situations where a key must be created to allow only occasional sorting (for example,
when running infrequent reports), set this property to **false** to prevent slow
modifications to the table.

This property is mostly used in the case where the key definition is for a SIFT index.

dataset are grouped by the day, month, or year, depending on the **Method** property
setting.

For more information about date methods, see Retrieving Date Data in Queries.

```
AL
```
A totals method performs a calculation on fields in a column and returns a single value.
When you set a totals method on a column, the retrieved records are automatically
grouped by the other columns in the query. When grouped by a column, records that
have similar values for the column are grouped together. The totals method is applied
against the records in the group. A summary value is calculated for the group and
returned in a single row for the group in the dataset. The **Method** property values
correspond to the SQL aggregate functions SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, and COUNT in SQL
SELECT statements.

Method = Day;

Except for the **Count** method, you can only use a totals method on a field that has a
numeric data type of **Decimal** , **Integer** , **BigInteger** , or **Duration**. The totals method
returns a decimal value that is calculated from values of all fields in a column.

**Count** is only associated with its parent **DataItem** , not a specific column. Therefore,
when you set a column to **Count** , you leave the DataSource Property of the column
blank. The **Count** method returns an integer value that corresponds to the number of
rows that are returned from the table that is specified by the data item associated with
the column.

Specifies namespaces on the XmlPort.

```
Xml Port
```
```
AL
```
You can use this property to declare one or more namespaces on the XMLport.

A namespace declaration consists of prefix and the namespace name, which has the
format _prefix_ = _namespace_. Separate multiple namespaces with a comma.

In the XML documents exported or imported by the XMLport, the namespaces
declarations are only supported in the <root> element. For example, if an XMLport has
the namespace **mybcprefix=mybcnamepace** and the default namespace
**urn:bc:schema:all** , then the root element will be as follows:

```
<Root xmlns:mybcprefix="mybcnamespace" xmlns="urn:bc:schema:all">
```
To specify a default namespace, set the prefix to "". You can also specify a default

namespace using the DefaultNamespace Property and setting the
UseDefaultNamespace Property to **true**.

## Applies to

## Syntax

```
Namespaces = bc = 'urn:microsoft-dynamics-bc/xmlports/x100';
```
## Remarks

```

You can use this property together with the InitValue Property to make sure that an
entry is made in this field. This setting is evaluated for controls and fields during
validation. Validation occurs only if the field or control value is updated through the UI,
for example, if a value is updated on a page or if a field is updated in a table directly. If a
field is updated through application code, then the **NotBlank** property is not validated.

You can set the **NotBlank** property to **true** on primary fields in a table. Setting the
**NotBlank** property to **true** on other fields in a table does not cause a red star marking
on the UI.

If the **NotBlank** property is used on other fields than primary fields, the behavior is as
follows:

```
If the field is blank, and never entered, the page can be closed.
```
```
If the field has been entered, and the user tries to enter a blank value, a validation
error occurs.

In this example, values are set up for Danish (DAN), German Standard (DEU), and
Spanish Traditional Sort (ESP).

The following examples demonstrate the relationship between the OptionMembers
Property and the OptionCaptionML property on fields (or variables) and controls.

1. An Option field in a table has the following OptionMembers Property value:
    opt1,opt2,op3. The value of OptionCaptionML is not set. A page based on this
    table contains a text box that is based on the Option field. OptionString and
    OptionCaptionML are not set for the text box.

```
Result Users see opt1, opt2, and opt3 as the available choices.
```
2. An OptionCaptionML property is added to the database field containing DAN =
    'valg1,valg2,valg3', ENG = 'choice1,choice2,choice3'.

```
Result If a user selects DAN as the language, valg1, valg2, valg3 will be the
available choices on the page. If a user selects ENG, choice1, choice2, choice3 will
be available. For more information about what happens when the selected
language is not available, see Working with Translation Files.

# OrderBy Property

Version : Available or changed with runtime version 3.0.
```
Sorts table fields in the page view in ascending or descending order.

```
Page View
Query
```
_Column_ = **Ascending** | **Descending**

```
Column is the name of the query column as specified by its Name Property.
```
```
Ascending sorts the column from lowest value to the highest value (A to Z, 0 to 9).
```
```
Descending sorts the column from highest value to the lowest value (Z to A, 9 to
0).
```
In the OrderBy property, you add a column by name and set its direction to ascending
or descending:

```
AL
```
## Applies to

## Property Value

```
```
Separate multiple columns with a comma.
```
## Remarks

```
view(MyFirstView)
{
Caption = 'This is my first view!';
OrderBy = Ascending (Address);
}
```

To sort on multiple columns, separate each column with a comma, like OrderBy =

ascending (Name), descending (Quantity).

The **OrderBy** property corresponds to the Order By clause in SQL select statements.

This following table shows the results of a query that retrieves the quantity of items in
every open sales order for each customer.

descending order, you set the OrderBy property to
Name=Ascending,Quantity=Descending. The following table shows the results of the query

after sorting.

```
Customer Quantity

# Permissions Property

Article•11/25/2024

```
```
X or x Execute Specifies direct (X) or indirect (x) execute permission.
```
The following AL code sets permissions to read/insert/modify/delete data in the table
**MyTable** as well as permission to run the codeunit **MyCodeUnit** , open the page
**MyPage** , and run the report **MyReport**.

```
AL
```
The license determines the permissions that users have in Dynamics 365 Business
Central. These permissions are further refined by the security permission sets that
administrators grant to users. For data, the types of access are **Read** , **Insert** , **Modify** , and
**Delete**. A user with Read permission can open the page that displays the data from a
table, for example, the Item or Customer tables. However, to change or delete the data
the user must have Modify and Delete permissions.

Sometimes the license or permission set only give user indirect permission to perform
operations on certain data in tables (TableData). A user who has Indirect Read
permission cannot open a page that displays data from a table unless the page has
been given permission to read data from the table for the user. That means the user can
perform an action on the data only through another object (see Applies To). In other
words, if you only have indirect permission to, for example, insert data into a particular
table, you cannot insert data into this table from the standard user interface. You must
use a database object that has been given extra permission to insert data into the table.

By default, objects do not have the permission property defined and use the same
permissions as the user. However for special cases, such as various Ledger Entries tables,
users do not have write or modify permissions. Instead, users should run posting
routines that create ledger entries on behalf of user.

### Example

```
Permissions =
tabledata MyTable = RIMD,
codeunit MyCodeUnit = X,
page MyPage = X,
report MyReport = X
```
### Remarks


You can give users access to an object, but only through another object. This is called
giving "Indirect" permission. For example, a user can have permission to run codeunit
80, Sales-Post. The Sales-Post codeunit performs many tasks, including modifying table
37, Sales Line. When the user posts a sales document by using the Sales-Post codeunit,
Business Central checks whether the user has permission to modify the Sales Line table.
If not, the codeunit cannot complete its tasks, and the user receives an error message. If
so, the codeunit runs successfully.

However, the user does not need full access to the Sales Line table to run the codeunit.
If the user has Indirect permission for the Sales Line table, then the Sales-Post codeunit
runs successfully. When a user has Indirect permission, that user can only modify the
Sales Line table by running the Sales-Post codeunit or another object that has
permission to modify the Sales Line table. The user can only modify the Sales Line table
when doing so from supported application areas. The user cannot run the feature
inadvertently or maliciously by other methods.

The following table illustrates how the Permission property works with the permissions
granted to an object by the license or a permission set. The table shows the runtime
results when the Permission property is set and when it isn't.

```
Permissions granted by
permission set
```
```
Permission property not set Permission property set
```
```
None Runtime error caused by

```
```
Runtime error caused by
missing permissions.
Indirect permission Runtime error caused by

```
```
Success
```
```
Direct permission Success Success
User has full access to the data.
```
The following example shows how to specify the permissions property for the codeunit
used for customer ledger entries. You can define the permissions property in other
objects in the same way.

```
AL
```
### Example - Indirect Permission

```
ﾉ Expand table
```
```

７ Note
```
```
After you set the Permissions property of an object, only users with direct
permission to perform all the extra operations that the object has been given can
modify this object.
```
```
Do not use the Permissions property to give extra permissions to an object that
you would like your users to be able to modify. These users might not have direct
permission to perform these operations. This is why you should be careful when
you use the Permissions property for tables and pages.

# PrintOnlyIfDetail Property

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Specifies whether to print data in a report for the parent data item when the child data
item does not generate any output.

```
Report Data Item
```
**True** if you want print only if the child data item generates output; otherwise, **false**. The
default is **false**.

```
AL
```
This property has no effect on a data item that does not have any child data items. If this
property is **false** and there is no record in the child data item that corresponds to the
current record in the parent data item, then the report prints data from the current
record in the parent data item, even though there is no data for the child data item. If
this property is **true** and there is no record in the child data item that corresponds to the
current record in the parent data item, then the report does not print data from the
current record in the parent data item.

If there are more than two data items, then the report iterates through each parent-child
relationship in the same way.

Another way to achieve the result of not printing blank lines is to add a filter on the
table. For more information, see SetFilter Method (Record).

## Applies to

## Property Value

## Syntax

```
PrintOnlyIfDetail = true;
```
## Remarks


In previous versions of Dynamics 365 Business Central reports, you could control
whether data items without data were printed with the use of body sections in Section
Designer. After you upgrade reports in Dynamics 365 Business Central, verify whether
you need to use filters or the **PrintOnlyIfDetail** property to achieve the same resulting
report.

In this example, you create a report to print data from the Sales Header and Sales Line
tables. The parent data item is Sales Header. For each record in the Sales Header table,
the report iterates through records in the Sales Line table.

Promoted actions appear in the action bar on a page. You promote an action by setting
the Promoted Property to **true**. You use the PromotedCategory Property to set the
category of an action, which allows you to group similar actions under a common
caption. You can choose between 20 categories: New, Process, Report, and Category4
through Category20.

By default, the category names are used as the captions in the ribbon. You use this
property to customize these captions. The new caption names must be expressed as a
string list, where the first three places correspond to the captions of the New, Process
and Report categories, respectively, the fourth place to Category4's caption, the fifth to
Category5's and so on.

This property is only applicable when the Promoted Property is set to **true**. For example,
if you have an action defined under the **ActionItems** action container, and you set the
**Promoted** and **PromotedOnly** properties to **true** , then in the client, the action will be
shown on the **Home** tab but will be hidden on the **Actions** tab.

This property in not relevant on the tablet and phone because only promoted actions
are displayed on these clients.

# QuickEntry Property

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.

Specifies if the page control should have input focus. The default value of the property
is true. To specify that a control can be skipped, change this value to false.

Specifying an expression as the value of the property is not supported.

```
Page Field
```
**true** specifies that the field has input focus when users move through fields by selecting
Enter; **false** specifies the field to be skipped. The default is **true**.

This property helps accelerate data entry, when using the keyboard, by only focusing on
those fields a user typically fills in; skipping those that are rarely filled in. The **QuickEntry**
property is respected when users select the Enter key. This behavior differs from using
the Tab key, which will sequentially give input focus to all page controls. By using this
property, you define a path for entering data, which is beneficial for repetitive data entry
tasks.

As a developer, the **QuickEntry** property can also be set by Use Designer (see Use
Designer). In the client, users can change the setting for their workspace by using

```
AL
```
This example illustrates how to dynamically set the **QuickEntry** property in the Dynamics
NAV Client connected to Business Central by using a Boolean field on the page. The
code modifies the **Customer Card** page so that the **Credit Limit (LCY)** field is skipped if
the **Allow Invoice Discount** field is not selected.

```
AL
```
Now, when a user enables **Allow Invoice Disc.** on the customer card, the **Credit Limit
(LCY)** field gets focus when the user presses Enter. Without this modification, focus skips
over the field when the user presses Enter.

### Example 1

```
pageextension 50100 CustomerCardExt extends "Customer Card"
{
layout
{
modify("Credit Limit (LCY)")
{
QuickEntry = false;
}
```
```
}

Reads all data, regardless of whether it has been committed

from table rows that have been modified by another running

This mode is sometimes referred to as a dirty read. For those
familiar with SQL, this translates to reading the data with
‘Read Uncommitted’.

No additional locks are placed on the read data. Because the
query does not lock the rows it reads, other transactions can
also read, modify, and delete the same data as the query.

Setting the property to ReadUncommitted can improve
performance compared to ReadShared and ReadExclusive.
However, the query can read data that potentially is rolled
back or changed by another transaction when the query is
running.

The ReadState property will overrule the current transaction type of the data as set by a
CurrentTransactionType Method (Database) call in the AL code because queries ignore
the CurrentTransactionType method call.

Each query will use the specified ReadState regardless of other queries that have already
been executed. This means that you can read uncommitted data and committed data
from the same tables in the same transaction. However, the strictest lock placed on a
row will remain until the transaction is committed.

# RecordSeparator Property

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Sets the string that is to be used to separate records.

```
Xml Port
```
**RecordSeparator** property is only used if the **Format Property** is set to **Variable Text** or
**Fixed Text**. Otherwise, the setting is ignored.

This property specifies how records should be separated. The default value is a new line
( **<NewLine>** ).

The strings in the preceding table must be entered literally, that is, the **<** and **>**
characters must be entered. These special strings can be combined and can be mixed
with other characters.

CR refers to the character with ASCII value 13.

LF refers to the character with ASCII value 10.

You can set the record separator in AL code so that the XMLport can import and export
records with different separators. For example, if your XMLport must import from a file
or stream where one record uses **NewLine** and another uses **TAB** , you can change the
record separator at run time.

## Applies to

## Remarks

```
７ Note
```
```
Do not use a semicolon in a quoted argument as other properties' value when you
import a file through an XMLport. Even in a quoted argument, the semicolon is
interpreted as a record separator.

You can use this property to optimize re-initialization of the control add-in when it has
already been initialized earlier. For example, this could be used to redraw some of the
visuals without the need for expensive fetching of data.

This property is optional. If left blank, the script defined by StartupScript will be invoked
when the control add-in is recreated.

valid literal path and wildcard characters (* and ?). However, it doesn't support regular
expressions.

Although this property is optional, the control add-in must either specify the
StartupScript property or specify one or more scripts. Scripts can be either external
resources referenced using a URL or can be embedded within the extension. Embedded
script files must be added to the extension project folder in Visual Studio Code and
referenced using a relative path. For security and usability reasons, it's recommended to
reference any external scripts by using the HTTPS protocol. Scripts are loaded
immediately when the control add-in is initialized.

Starting from runtime 13, you can store control add-in resources in a location relative to
the file that contains the source code of the control add-in. This provides more flexibility
in organizing and locating control add-in resources.

When the system needs to locate these resources, it follows a specific search order; first,
it looks for the resources in a location relative to the root of the project. If the resources
aren't found there, it then searches in a location relative to the source file of the control
add-in.

The following example shows the two options for organizing control add-in resources;
scripts, images, and stylesheets. For the file MyControlAddIn.al, the resources are
organized in two different ways.

# ShowAs Property

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 10.0.
```
Specifies how an action group should be rendered

```

```
Value Available or changed
with
```
```
Description
```
```
Standard runtime version 10.0 Specifies that an action group should be rendered as a
standard group.
SplitButton runtime version 10.0 Specifies that an action group should be rendered as a
split button.
```
```
AL
```
By specifying that the group should be rendered as **SplitButton** , the group is rendered
as a combination of a button and a menu. This type of control gives you a fast one-click
access to the first action, which is set to Visible and to Enabled in a menu via the left
button part and access to other related actions via the right dropdown part.

## Applies to

## Property value

```
ﾉ Expand table
```
## Syntax

```
ShowAs = SplitButton;
```
## Remarks

```
７ Note
```

Be aware of the following design guidance:

```
Split buttons aren't supported in context menus. When the feature key
ModernActionBar is turned off, then it isn't supported if the ShowAs property is set
to SplitButton on a promoted action category group.
Mobile clients don't support split buttons and if the ShowAs property is set to
SplitButton, it will be ignored.
Any tooltip, caption, or image property set on a group, isn't rendered, if the group
is defined as a split button. It's still a best practice to set these properties, because
they're used, if the group is rendered as a regular group, for example, on mobile
clients.
A split button can be nested inside another split button.
For personalization from the UI, it's possible to drop an action into a split button
and the action will then become the primary action, if the action is enabled and
visible. During personalization it's also possible to reorder the child actions, which
will dynamically update the primary action as necessary.
```
```
AL
```
The group MyGroup will be rendered as split button, which gives you a one-click access

to the action MyAction.

The following example illustrates split button behavior if you use a promoted action
category with the ShowAs property.

```
Re-ordering the actions in a split button group from a page extension or page
customization can change the action used for the split button.
```
### Example

```
group(MyGroup)
{
ShowAs = SplitButton;
action(MyAction)

# ShowMandatory Property

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Sets a value that specifies whether users must enter a value in the selected field or text
box. The field is marked on the page with a red asterisk and does not enforce any
validation. Once the field is filled, the red asterisk disappears. The ShowMandatory
property only controls the UI and overrides any asterisk marking of the NotBlank
Property.

The ShowMandatory property can be specified as true, false, or as an expression.

For an example, see the Purchase Invoice page where the Vendor Invoice No field is
controlled by the VendorInvoiceNoMandatory expression. VendorInvoiceNoMandatory
is a variable that takes the value from the Ext. Doc. No. Mandatory field on the Purchase
page and the Payables page.

Using expressions has the limitation that number fields with default values, will be
interpreted as having a value, and will not be marked with a red asterisk. For example,
on the Customer page, on the Credit Limit field, using an expression like Credit Limit;
5000 will not result in a red asterisk, even if the value is below 5000, because the field
already has a default value.

Also, be aware that while it is possible to use an expression for the ShowMandatory
property, the property cannot validate an AL function.

```

independently of the NotBlank Property. The **ShowMandatory** property can be used to
mark all page fields, but does not enforce any validation of the field. This means that the

If you set SQL Data Type to Varchar, all the values in the field are compared and sorted
as character data, including numeric values.

If you set SQL Data Type to Integer, then the following are true:

```
All the values in the field are compared and sorted as integers. No alphanumeric
values can be stored in the field.
```
```
If you enter negative values in the column outside Dynamics 365 Business Central
using external tools, they cannot be read into Dynamics 365 Business Central.
```
```
The value "0" (zero) is used to represent an empty string in Dynamics 365 Business
Central.
```
```
Non-numeric code values or any numeric values beginning with "0" (zero) cannot
be entered in the code field.
```
If you set SQL Data Type to Variant, then the following are true:

```
The values in the field are compared and sorted according to their base data type.
Numeric values are sorted after alphanumeric values.
```
```
Data that is entered into the code field in Dynamics 365 Business Central is stored
as either the Varchar or Integer base data type, depending on the value that has
been entered.
```
```
Any value beginning with "0" (zero) can be entered in the code field and is stored
as an Integer base data type.
```
```
The Variant option is represented by the SQL_VARIANT SQL data type that has been
introduced in SQL Server 2000 and is not supported by SQL Server 7.0. This means
that selecting Variant as the SQL Data Type property when creating or modifying a
table on SQL Server 7.0 results in an error.

## Remarks


The **Style** property works together with the StyleExpr Property value to determine
whether the field is formatted. If the StyleExpr Property evaluates to **true** , then the value
of the field is formatted as specified by the **Style** property.

By default, the **Style** property is not set.

This property is not supported if one of the following data types is used for the
SourceExpr of the field:

```
Code
Boolean
Binary
BLOB
GUID
RecordID
```
On pages, you use the **Style** property for group, part, field, and action controls. You can
change the formatting of a control either statically by setting the StyleExpr Property to
**true** or **false** , or dynamically by using a Boolean variable or a Boolean field on the page.
The Boolean field on the page can be either a true/false Boolean or a Boolean
expression, such as “Credit Limit > Sales YTD”.

The following code sample shows how to make the text of the field control "Code" bold
using the **Style** property. The text will be formatted only if the Boolean variable
Emphasize evaluates to **true**.

# StyleSheets Property

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Specifies the list of stylesheets to include in the control add-in. The stylesheets could be
local files in the package or references to external files using the http or the https
protocol.

```
Control Add In
```
A list of comma-separated strings that represent paths to stylesheet files. The default is
blank, with no stylesheets being used by the control add-in.

With runtime 11, you can specify multiple files within the same path string by using a
combination of a valid literal path and wildcard characters (* and ?). However, it doesn't
support regular expressions.

This property is optional and used to specify stylesheets that apply to the control add-in
visuals. Stylesheets can be either external resources referenced using a URL or can be
embedded within the extension. Embedded stylesheets must be added to the extension
project folder in Visual Studio Code and referenced using a relative path. Stylesheets are
loaded immediately when the control add-in is initialized.

## Applies to

## Property Values

## Remarks

```
） Important
```
```
In extensions for Business Central online, don't reference font files in stylesheets,
because the fonts won't display in client. Instead, do one of the following:
```
```
Reference the font files from some other source such as a public or private
CDN.
Base64 encode the fonts and include the encoded fonts in the CSS file.

parameter (named Rec) for the specified table. For example, the following code sets the

**TableNo** property in a codeunit to the **Item** table.

```

# TableRelation Property

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Sets up a lookup into another table. The following syntax is valid for the TableRelation
property:

```
Table field
Page Field
```
The TableRelation property lets you establish lookups into other tables. For example,

on the Item card you can select a vendor from who you usually purchase an item. This is
done through a table relationship.

This property is also used to define where to look to validate entries.

In addition, when you choose the option to test the relationships between primary and
secondary indexes, this property defines what to test.

This example shows a simple application of the TableRelation property for creating a

Vendors sub-table by filtering between the records to include only the ones where the
purchase expenses are higher than 10,000.

```
TableRelation = <TableName>[.<FieldName>] [WHERE(<TableFilters>)] |
[IF(<Conditions>) <TableName>[.<FieldName>] [WHERE(<TableFilters>)] ELSE
<TableRelation>]
<Conditions> ::= <TableFilters>
<TableFilters>::= <TableFilter> {,<TableFilter>}
<TableFilter>::= <DestinationFieldName>=CONST(<FieldConst>) |
FIELD(<SourceFieldName>)
```
## Applies to

## Remarks

## Example


```
AL
```
Moreover, the TableRelation property can be modified through a table extension.

Modifications to the TableRelation are additive and evaluated after the existing value.
The primary use case is conditional table relations based on conditional enums. The
following example illustrates how to define first, an enum, and then a table setting a
TableRelation.

```
AL
```
```
table 50100 "Main Vendors"
{
fields
{
field( 1 ; "Vendor No."; Code[ 20 ])
{
DataClassification = ToBeClassified;
TableRelation = Vendor."No." where ("Balance (LCY)" = filter (>=
10000 ));
{
field( 2 ; "Vendor Name"; Text[ 150 ])
{
DataClassification = ToBeClassified;
FieldClass = FlowField;
CalcFormula = lookup (Vendor.Name where ("No." = field ("Vendor
No.")));
}
}
}
```
```
enum 50120 TypeEnum
{
Extensible = true;
value( 0 ; Nothing) { }
value( 1 ; Customer) { }

The next code sample implements a table extension of the table defined above and an
enum extension. The combined table relation is evaluated top-down. That means that
the first unconditional relation will prevail, meaning that you cannot change an existing
TableRelation from Customer to Item, since the original table relation is unconditional.

# TableSeparator Property

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Specifies the table separator for a table.

```
Xml Port
```
```
AL
```
**TableSeparator** property is only used if the **Format Property** is set to **Variable Text** or
**Fixed Text**. Otherwise, the setting is ignored.

This property specifies how tables should be separated. The default value is (two
newlines) ( **<NewLine><NewLine>** ).

The strings in the preceding table must be entered literally, that is, the **<** and **>**
characters must be entered. These special strings can be combined and can be mixed
with other characters.

CR refers to the character with ASCII value 13.

LF refers to the character with ASCII value 10.

You can set the table separator in AL code so that the XMLport can import and export
tables with different separators. For example, if your XMLport must import from a file or
stream where one table uses a single **NewLine** elements and another uses two **NewLine**
elements, you can change the table separator at run time.

## Applies to

## Syntax

Tables that are marked as **CDS** or **ExternalSQL** are considered external tables that are
not managed by Dynamics 365 Business Central. These tables use a different SQL Server
connection than the normal tables in the Dynamics 365 Business Central database.

Marking a table as **Temporary** is the same as:

```
Setting "SourceTableTemporary" on all pages that use the table. See
SourceTableTemporary Property.
```
Temporary tables are not synchronized with the SQL database, so they do not follow the
same rules about making destructive changes.

You can change an existing table from **Normal** to **Temporary**. But the table will be
deleted from the database when you synchronize the extension. If the table contains
data, you'll have to use the ForceSync mode.

For more information, see Temporary Tables.

property will resolve to Restrictive at runtime.
```
```
Restrictive runtime

will cause the permission execution context of every
test in the codeunit to be set by default to 'D365 Full
Access’. It is required to lower the level of permissions
within every test to any permission sets other than
'D365 Full Access’. Otherwise, it will result in a runtime
error. The change of the permission execution context
is supported by Codeunit "Library - Lower Permissions".
NonRestrictive runtime

```
```
Setting the NonRestrictive value will cause that the
permission execution context of every test in the

The default value of TestPermissions is Restrictive. The **TestPermissions** property

works together with the **OnBeforeTestRun** and **OnAfterTestRun** triggers in test runner
codeunits. The value of the **TestPermissions** property is passed as a parameter to the
test runner codeunit triggers. The permission sets that are used during a test are
determined by the code that you add to the triggers. Typically, you use the
**OnBeforeTestRun** trigger to apply permissions sets and the **OnAfterTestRun** trigger to
clear permissions sets.

Tests have the TestPermissions property by default set to Restrictive. With the

**Permissions Mock** system app in the test framework library, you can mock permissions
when running unit tests. The **Permissions Mock** module can be used to add permissions
sets to the running test user, or limit the user's permissions.

## Remarks


File Handling and Text Encoding is the process of transforming bytes of data into
readable characters for users of a system or program. There are several industry File
Handling and Text Encoding formats and different systems support different formats.
Internally, Dynamics 365 Business Central uses Unicode encoding. For exporting and
importing data with an XMLport, Dynamics 365 Business Central supports MS-DOS,
UTF-8, UTF-16, and Windows encoding formats.

The Text data type in AL uses the in AL uses UTF-16 encoding, the same encoding as
.NET strings. For more information, see String class (.NET).

You should set the **TextEncoding** property to the encoding format that is compatible
with the system or program that you will be exporting to or importing from. The
following sections describe the available File Handling and Text Encoding formats.

The following code example illustrates how you can set the encoding during run time.

```
AL
```
The code example is based on XMLport 1220 in the CRONUS International Ltd.
demonstration database. The table, **MyDefinitionTable** , has a field, **File Encoding** , that

```
 Tip
```
```
You can also set the TextEncoding property in AL code using the TextEncoding
Method. For example, if your XMLport can import or export different formats
based on certain conditions, you can change the encoding on the fly depending on
the conditions. For example, you can write code such as one of the following:
```
```
currXMLport.TextEncoding := TextEncoding::Windows;
currXMLport.TextEncoding(TextEncoding::Windows);
```
### Example

```
...
case MyDefinitionTable."File Encoding" of
MyDefinitionTable."File Encoding"::"MS-DOS":
currXMLport.TextEncoding(TextEncoding::MSDos);
MyDefinitionTable."File Encoding"::"UTF-8":
currXMLport.TextEncoding(TextEncoding::UTF8);

_MaxLength_
Type: Integer
Sets the maximum length of the specific ToolTip.

The default is an empty string, which means there will be no tooltip. According to the
user assistance model for Business Central, apps are expected to apply tooltips to
controls on pages. Tooltips can be up to 1024 characters long, exceeding this doesn't
throw an error, but the rest of the tooltip is truncated .... The best practice is to not

exceed 200 characters. For more information, see Guidelines for tooltip text.

With the Locked parameter, you can specify that the tooltip shouldn't be translated. This

is useful when the tooltip is a technical term or a proper name, for example. The
Comment parameter is used to provide additional information about the tooltip, for

example, to explain why the tooltip shouldn't be translated. The MaxLength parameter is

used to specify the maximum length of the tooltip. If the tooltip exceeds the maximum
length, the rest of the tooltip is truncated ....

You use the **TopNumberOfRows** property to limit the resulting dataset to the first set of
rows that are generated for the query. For example, you can include only the first 10 or
first 100 rows in the resulting dataset. The TopNumberOfRows property is useful for key
performance indicators such as the top number of customers or sales.

You can also specify the number of rows to include in the dataset by calling the
TopNumberOfRows Method from AL. The TopNumberOfRows method will overwrite the
**TopNumberOfRows** property setting.

There are four basic transaction types: **Browse** , **Snapshot** , **UpdateNoLocks** , and **Update**.
Additionally, there is a **Report** type that maps to the **Browse** transaction type. Each
transaction type defines the behavior of a transaction in Dynamics 365 Business Central
and takes effect from the start of a transaction. A transaction starts at the start of the

outermost code or immediately after the Commit Method (Database) is called. A
transaction ends at the end of the outermost code or when the Commit method is
called. For example, if a method in a codeunit calls another codeunit, then a new
transaction is not started at the start of the second codeunit.

The following table shows transaction behavior with SQL Server.

```
Transaction
Type
```
```
Behavior
```
```
Browse This is a read-only transaction. Modifications cannot occur within the
transaction. All read operations are performed with READ UNCOMMITTED
locking. Therefore, no locks are added and locks that are added by other
sessions are not honored. This means that the transaction may read
uncommitted data.
```
```
For more information about READ UNCOMMITTED locking, see SET
TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL (Transact-SQL) in the MSDN Library.
Snapshot This is a read-only transaction. Modifications cannot occur within the
transaction. All read operations are performed with REPEATABLE READ locking.
Therefore, shared locks are added on all data and are maintained until the end
of the transaction. This prevents other transactions from modifying any rows
that have been read by the current transaction.
```
```
For more information about REPEATABLE READ locking, see SET TRANSACTION
ISOLATION LEVEL (Transact-SQL) in the MSDN Library.
```
```
UpdateNoLocks This is an update transaction. Modifications can occur within the transaction. All
read operations are performed with READ UNCOMMITTED locking until the
table is either modified by a write operation or locked with the LockTable
Method (Record). From this point until the end of the transaction, all read
operations are performed with UPDLOCK locking.
```
```
For more information about UPDLOCK locking, see Table Hints (Transact-SQL)
in the MSDN Library.
```
```
This transaction type improves concurrency for all tables that users access
within the transaction by delaying locking as much as it can. However, the
disadvantage is that you must know when to lock the tables for the required
transaction behavior.
```
```
This is the default transaction type if you have not specified a type with the
CurrentTransactionType Method (Database).

Update This is an update transaction. Modifications can occur within the transaction. All

Report and XMLport objects have a **TransactionType** property, which you can view and

report or XMLport object is used only when you run the report or XMLport from Object

７ Note
```
```
In earlier versions of Dynamics 365 Business Central, the Snapshot and Update
transaction types performed read operations with SERIALIZABLE locking until the
table was either modified by a write operation or locked with the LockTable
method. In Dynamics 365 Business Central, these transaction types perform read
operations with REPEATABLE READ locking until the table is either modified by a
write operation or locked with the LockTable method.
```
```
Phantom reads cannot occur with SERIALIZABLE locking because the filter range is
locked instead of the records. Phantom reads can occur with REPEATABLE READ
locking because only the records are locked. You should know this difference when
you upgrade from an earlier version to Dynamics 365 Business Central. For more
information about phantom reads, see Concurrency Effects in the MSDN Library.

#### Feedback

Selecting the best value for the TreeInitialState property on a repeater is a balance
between user experience and performance. Do consider the following when specifying a
value:

```
Some business tasks naturally require users to start with a high-level overview of
their data and then drill down to find deeply-nested records. Other tasks are more
efficient when they start by displaying the full list which users just need to scroll
through.
In general, lists that start fully expanded are loaded faster than lists that start
collapsed. The performance difference is negligible on lists with few records, but
indented lists with thousands of records will need to load significantly more
records when the page opens or the data is refreshed.

For example, your XMLport can export data in two different file formats. One format
contains 5 columns, and the other contains 10 columns. Instead of duplicating the
maximum number of columns and writing code that skips any redundant columns, you
can set up a single column, make it unbound, and then specify in code when to break to
the next element.

During an import, the XMLport will automatically move on to the next record when

**true** if the key value must be unique; otherwise, **false**. The default is **false**.

A unique index ensures that records in a table do not have identical field values. With a

checked for uniqueness. If the table includes records with duplicate values for the field,
the validation fails.

The UnknownValueImplementation property applies to enums. Uninstalling enum
extensions can result in persisted values becoming unknown. The
UnknownValueImplementation provides a generic error handling in such cases. Enums are

often used to select an interface implementation. However, due to the nature of an
extensible development model, an enum extension and its corresponding interface
implementation can be uninstalled from a tenant, while the value for the specific enum
is still available, but now pointing to an unknown value. Using the
UnknownValueImplementation property when defining an enum prevents throwing a
technical error message in the UI and allows for a more user-friendly error handling.

Related to UnknownValueImplementation is the DefaultImplementation property, used for
fallback to a default value when no enum value is provided. For more information, see
DefaultImplementation Property.

If you want to let users enter any value without validating the entry, then choose **false**.
For example, on the **Item** card, you can specify the vendor that you typically purchase
the item from. Set this property to **false** to allow users to select a vendor that may not
already be in the **Vendor** table. It will then be up to the field's OnValidate trigger to
process what the user has typed, for example create a new vendor with that name.

If you set the ValidateTableRelation property to **false** , then you should also set the
TestTableRelation property to **false**. Otherwise, a database test on the field relations in a
database may fail.

## Lookup behavior


#### Feedback

**Was this page helpful?**

Provide product feedback

Whether the property is set to **true** or **false** , as a user types data in the field, a lookup
opens and shows a filtered list of entries that match what was typed. The difference is
how the lookup behaves:

```
When true , the entry that best matches what the user has typed is automatically
selected in the lookup. Selecting the Tab or Enter key will save the selected entry.
If there's no entry that matches what the user has typed, the empty lookup stays
open. Selecting Tab or Enter when there's no match causes a validation error.
When false , no entry is automatically selected in the lookup - focus stays on the
field. Selecting Tab or Enter will save whatever value the user has entered so far,
letting the user enter free text. If there's no entry that matches what the user has
typed, the lookup closes. To select an entry in the lookup, the user has to do it
manually, for example, by selecting the down arrow to move focus into the lookup.
```
TestTableRelation Property

```
７ Note
```
```
The behavior of the lookup when the ValidateTableRelation property is set to false
was changed in Business Central 2020 release wave 1 (runtime 9.0). In earlier
versions, the lookup has a slightly different behavior. When typing in the field,
focus switches to an entry in the lookup. Also, the lookup stays open even if there's
no match to what is typed in the field.
```
```
 Tip
```
```
If the field isn't part of a key, using the OnAfterLookup (page field) trigger can be
useful way to resolve the right record when a user picks something from a lookup
that's not a key.

# VerticalShrink Property

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
VerticalShrink specifies that the control add-in can be made smaller vertically. This
setting is optional.

```
Control Add In
```
**True** if the control add-in is allowed to shrink vertically. The default value is **false**.

VerticalShrink is typically used together with the MinimumHeight property. If
VerticalShrink is **true** but MinimumHeight is not set, the control add-in can shrink to
nothing. When the add-in shrinks in size, the visual content must remain visible and
accessible to users. To provide the best experience, consider implementing a responsive
design that can adapt to reduced space and vertical scrollbars.

**True** on pages if you want the page or control to be visible; otherwise, **false** on pages.
The default is **true** on pages.

```
AL
```
## Applies to

## Property value

## Syntax

```
Visible = false;
```
## Remarks


Because this property also applies to containers, such as pages and subpages, if the
**Visible** property for the container is set to **false** , then controls on the container are also
not displayed, even if the **Visible** property is set to **true**.

On pages, you use the **Visible** property to show or hide group, part, field, and action
controls. You can show or hide the control either statically by setting the property to
**true** or **false** , or dynamically by using a Boolean variable or a Boolean field on the page.
The Boolean field on the page can be either a true/false Boolean or a Boolean
expression, such as "Credit Limit > Sales YTD".

Using a variable for field and action controls requires that the variable be resolved by
the OnInit Trigger or OnOpenPage Trigger.

When a part, field, action, or view is hidden by setting the **Visible** property, users are
able to access and display that control again using personalization and role
customization features in the user interface. The **Visible** property is not a replacement
for user permissions or the application of proper security practices.

When the **Visible** property is specified by a Boolean variable, users can choose to hide
the control while the Boolean evaluates to true, but cannot forcibly show the control
while the control Boolean evaluates to false.

Even if a field on page is hidden by setting the **Visible** property, the data behind the
field will still be loaded.

###### Dynamic visibility of controls

```
７ Note
```
```
You can also use as property value a Boolean variable that evaluates to true or
false. To use a variable for the Visible property, it must be set as a global page
variable.
```
```
７ Note
```
```
The dynamic options are only possible for group, part, and action controls.

# WordLayout Property

Sets the Word layout that is used on a report and returns it as a data stream.

```

```
The Word file must be in the same folder as the AL object.

## Applies to

```
７ Note
```
```
Reports support both Excel, RDL, and Word layouts. For more information, see
DefaultLayout Property.
```
## Remarks

```
２ Warning
```
```
Using the report properties DefaultLayout , ExcelLayout , RDLCLayout , and
WordLayout should be avoided as these properties will be deprecated in a later
release. Instead, it's recommended to use the property DefaultRenderingLayout
together with the new rendering syntax introduced in runtime version 9.0.
```
```
In Visual Studio Code, when hovering over any line with the ExcelLayout ,
RDLLayout , or WordLayout property, you can use the code action Convert to
'Rendering' to convert to the new rendering syntax.
```
```
For more information, see DefaultRenderingLayout Property.
```
```
The use of any of these report properties impact performance as every call loads
the full layout in memory even if the intent is only to check if a given report had a
layout of the given type.

# WordMergeDataItem Property

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Specifies the root-level DataItem that is used to generate separate reports for multiple
records.

```
Report
```
```
AL
```
The WordMergeDataItem property is only applied when rendering a report using a Word
layout.

When you specify a dataitem in the WordMergeDataItem property, the Business Central

server does a "Mail merge" between that data item (and the ones below it) and the
Word layout when rendering the report using the Word layout.

In versions before Business Central 2024 release wave 2, Business Central Server
implements the document merging by first generating the full merged document in
Word. Then, it inserts Word sections to reset headers, footers, and page numbers
between each document generated from the WordMergeDataItem. This behavior means
that the use of Word sections in layouts for reports using the WordMergeDataItem

property aren't allowed. At runtime, the Business Central Server shows an error message
such as You cannot run the report because the {0} layout contains section breaks

that conflict with the sections in the report. Remove the section breaks from the
report layout, and then run the report.

## Applies to

## Syntax

```
WordMergeDataItem = MyDataItem; // MyDataItem must be present as a top-level
dataitem in the report dataset
```
## Remarks


Starting from version 2024 release wave 2, the Business Central Server implements the
document merging by generating one document in Word for each row in the
WordMergeDataItem. It then converts each document to a PDF and merges all the PDF
documents. As a result, there's no longer the restriction on using Word sections in
layouts for reports using the WordMergeDataItem property.

The following example is showing how the WordMergeDataItem property is used on the

"Standard Sales - Invoice" report when rendered with a Word layout.

Here, the Word layout is applied to each element in the _Header_ dataitem. So, if you
defined a different first page, page numbers, totals at the end, and similar report design
elements in the Word layout, they're "reset" for each element in the _Header_ dataitem.

```
AL
```
### Example

```
report 1306 "Standard Sales - Invoice"
{
// Other report properties set here
WordMergeDataItem = Header;
```
```
dataset
{
dataitem(Header; "Sales Invoice Header")
{
...
}
}
```
```
...
rendering
{
layout("StandardSalesInvoice.docx")
{
Type = Word;
LayoutFile = './Sales/History/StandardSalesInvoice.docx';
Caption = 'Standard Sales Invoice (Word)';
Summary = 'The Standard Sales Invoice (Word) provides a simple
layout that is also relatively easy for an end-user to modify.';
}
// more layouts here
}
}

# Triggers overview

Article•10/01/2024

This section describes how triggers work in Business Central.

Triggers activate a method when a certain event occurs. When AL methods are run
because of a predefined event on either an object or a control, the event triggers the
method. Together the event and method make a trigger.

Triggers are useful for doing calculations and validations. Compared to properties, they
provide a more diverse, effective way of doing such operations. For example, you can
use triggers in reports to control how data is selected and retrieved.

There are different triggers for the various AL object types. Some triggers are set on the
object-level, while others are set on the controls. For example, a table has some triggers
on the table object and other triggers on field controls. Or consider reports, which have
some triggers on the report object and some on the data items. Trigger are typically
added at the end the code block for the object or control. Triggers have the following
syntax:

```
AL
```
```
 Tip
```
```
If you already know the name of, for example, a data type, method, property, or
trigger, use the Filter by title field in the upper left corner, above the table of
contents to find the topic faster. Otherwise, you can scan the table of contents to
find it.
```
## Coding triggers

```
trigger OnWhat()
var
myVariable: type;
begin
// Custom code
end;
```
## Snippet support


Typing the shortcut ttrigger will create the basic layout for a trigger when using the AL

Language extension for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central in Visual Studio Code.

The following example shows the basic trigger layout for a table object.

```
AL
```
```

property setting of the test codeunit to which it belongs.
```
_Ok_
Type: Boolean
**true** if the test was run, otherwise, **false**. The default value is **true**.

A test runner codeunit manages the execution of test codeunits that are run from its
OnRun trigger. When a test codeunit runs, it executes each test in the codeunit, one at a
time. The **OnBeforeTestRun** trigger is called before the test codeunit, the **OnRun** , and
each test.

You can use the **OnBeforeTestRun** triggers to perform preprocessing, such as general
initialization and logging, or to automate tests by integrating the test runner codeunit
with a test management framework.

By using the _Permissions_ parameter, you can add code to control which permission sets,
if any, to test.

The _FunctionName_ parameter is empty when the **OnBeforeTestRun** trigger is called for
the entire test codeunit.

The **OnBeforeTestRun** trigger is run in its own database transaction.

The following **OnBeforeTestRun** trigger code initializes a logging variable and returns
**true** to indicate that the test should execute.

### Return Value

# OnInsert (Table) trigger

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Runs when a user inserts a new record into the table.

```
AL
```
This trigger is run before default insert behavior, which checks that the record to be
inserted does not already exist before the insertion occurs. It runs automatically after the
user chooses to insert a new record in a page from the Web client. If a user inserts a
record using AL code, then the _RunTrigger_ argument of INSERT (Record) Method must
be set to **true** for the **OnInsert** Trigger to run, or otherwise it will not. The new record is
not inserted if an error occurs in the trigger code.

In tables where records are entered in pages that have the DelayedInsert Property set to
**true** , we recommend that you write any code that is in an OnInsert trigger so that it will
always succeed. For example, this applies to journal lines.

# OnModify (Table) trigger

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Runs when a user modifies an existing record in a table.

```
AL
```
This trigger is run before the default modify behavior, which checks that all the fields of
a record are valid before the modification occurs. It runs automatically when the user
changes at least one field (different from the primary key field) of a record in a page
from the Web Client. If a user modifies a record using AL code, then the _RunTrigger_
argument of MODIFY (Record) Method or MODIFYALL (Record) Method must be set to
**true** for the OnModify Trigger to run, or otherwise it will not. If an error occurs in the
trigger code, the record changes are canceled.

We recommend that you do not include code that can stop the user from recording a
change in the OnModify trigger on a table. For example, do not include code for
displaying error messages. If a user has previously changed the contents of some fields
in a record, then these changes must always be accepted by the system.

record using AL code, then the _RunTrigger_ argument of Insert (Record) Method must be
set to **true** for the **OnInsert** Trigger to run, or otherwise it will not. The new record is not
inserted if an error occurs in the trigger code.

In tables where records are entered in pages that have the DelayedInsert Property set to
**true** , we recommend that you write any code that is in an OnInsert trigger so that it will
always succeed. For example, this applies to journal lines.

We recommend that you do not include code that can stop the user from recording a
change in the **OnModify** trigger on a table. For example, do not include code for
displaying error messages. If a user has previously changed the contents of some fields
in a record, then these changes must always be accepted by the system.

# OnValidate (Field) trigger

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Runs when user input is validated.

```
AL
```
This trigger is run after the default validation behavior when data is entered in a field.
During the default validation behavior, the system checks that the data type of the value
entered matches the one defined for the field and that it complies with the property
constraints set up in such field before the validation occurs. An error message displays if
an error occurs in the trigger code. In case of an error, the user entry is not written to
the database.

The **OnValidate** trigger is also a field trigger at the page level. For more information, see
OnValidate (Page Fields) Trigger. If both the table field and page field triggers are
defined, then the **OnValidate** trigger on the table field is run before the **OnValidate**
trigger on the page field.

```
AL
```
## Syntax

```
trigger OnValidate()
begin
...
end;

tableextension 50111 "CustomerExt" extends Customer

# OnLookup (Field) trigger

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.

Runs when a lookup page is displayed.

```
AL
```
The Lookup Property must be set to **True** to enable the lookup.

There are three lookup options:

1. Default Lookup - The lookup into the table is performed without applying filters or
    other special parameters.
2. Field Lookup - You can use this trigger to define a field lookup that will be used in
    place of the default lookup.
3. Text box Lookup - You can use the OnLookup (Page fields) Trigger to define a
    lookup based on the value of a text box. This value will be used in place of the
    default lookup or the field lookup.

When using this trigger, follow this approach:

```
Use the field value to determine what filters or other parameters to apply.
```
```
Run the lookup page as a modal page.
```
```
Transfer the value the user selects back to the field when the user chooses OK.
```
If an error occurs in the trigger code, the lookup page is closed.

Use this trigger to calculate variables that depend on the current record.

This trigger is independent of the currently selected record in the UI. When it gets raised
depends on when the UI needs to load more data and the block size of the data read.
So, for example, in a list page, where rows are read in larger blocks, then the
OnAfterGetRecord trigger will be raised for each of the records read before the page is
shown.

Within the trigger, the Rec variable will refer to the record just read.

If there is an error in the trigger code, then the page is closed.

# OnPageBackgroundTaskCompleted

# (Page) trigger

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 4.0.
```
Runs after a page background task has successfully completed.

```
AL
```
_TaskId_
Type: Integer
Specifies the ID of the background task that was run. The ID is automatically assigned to
the background task when it is created.

_Results_
Type: Dictionary of [Text,Text]
Specifies the results of the page background task.

The callback triggers can't execute UI operations, except notifications and control
updates. This means that, for example, CurrPage.Update() statements are ignored
because they would in many cases lead to infinite loops when page background tasks
are started from the OnAfterGetCurrRecord trigger.

## Syntax

Use this trigger to calculate variables that depend on the current record.

This trigger is independent of the currently selected record in the UI. When it gets raised
depends on when the UI needs to load more data and the block size of the data read.
So, for example, in a list page, where rows are read in larger blocks, then the
OnAfterGetRecord trigger will be raised for each of the records read before the page is
shown.

Within the trigger, the Rec variable will refer to the record just read.

If there is an error in the trigger code, then the page is closed.

If the page that is closing and all its child pages return **true** in the OnQueryClosePage
trigger, then the OnClosePage Trigger is called for all child pages and then for the
parent page.

If an error occurs in the OnQueryClosePage trigger or it returns **false** , then the page is

is set to the same value as the parent page.

Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.

This trigger is executed after the OnInit Trigger.

You use the **OnOpenPage** trigger to change dynamic properties, including those which
can only be changed when the page is opened, such as the Visible Property. You can
also write to the database from the trigger.

The **OnOpenPage** trigger is the only trigger that can toggle the Visible Property and the
property can only be toggled on columns.

If an error occurs in the trigger execution, then the page closes.

## Syntax

```
trigger OnOpenPage()
begin
...
end;
```
## Remarks

```
７ Note
```
```
If you use the LockTable Record in the OnOpenPage trigger, then the table lock will
be released when the trigger completes execution and not when the user closes the
page.
```
```
７ Note
```
```
The OnOpenPage trigger does not support calls to control add-in methods and
properties because the trigger is invoked before the page is instantiated.

# OnAfterGetRecord (Page Extension)

```
Runs after a record is retrieved from a table but before it is displayed to the user.

AL

Use this trigger to calculate variables that depend on the current record.

This trigger is independent of the currently selected record in the UI. When it gets raised
depends on when the UI needs to load more data and the block size of the data read.
So, for example, in a list page, where rows are read in larger blocks, then the
OnAfterGetRecord trigger will be raised for each of the records read before the page is
shown.

Within the trigger, the Rec variable will refer to the record just read.

If there is an error in the trigger code, then the page is closed.

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Runs when a field loses focus after its value has been changed.

```
AL
```
This trigger is run after the default validation behavior when data is entered in a field.
During the default validation behavior, the system checks that the data type of the value
entered matches the one defined for the field and that it complies with the property
constraints set up in such field before the validation occurs. An error message displays if
an error occurs in the trigger code. In case of an error, the user entry is not written to
the database.

The OnValidate trigger is also a field trigger at the page level. For more information, see
OnValidate (Field) Trigger. If both the table field and page field triggers are defined, then
the OnValidate trigger on the table field is run before the OnValidate trigger on the
page field.

```

## Syntax

```
trigger OnValidate()

# OnAfterLookup (Page Field) trigger

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 7.0.
```
Runs after a lookup is activated passing the selected record as a RecordRef.

```
AL
```
_Selected_
Type: RecordRef
The selected record.

This trigger is introduced with runtime 7.0 of AL to address issues that arise when in
Business Central, for example, more items have the same Description. With former
solutions, the lookup mechanism would find the selected record based on the filtering
in the lookup dialog. This made it impossible to predict which record the user had
selected.

## Syntax

```
trigger OnAfterLookup(Selected: RecordRef)
begin
...
end;
```
## Parameters

## Remarks

```
７ Note
```
```
If you have defined an OnLookup Trigger , the OnAfterLookup Trigger will not be
fired.
```
## Example


The following is a simplified example of how the **OnAfterLookup** trigger can be used.
The No. and Description fields point to fields in the Item table and should be updated
at the same time, even if only one of the fields is available in a dropdown; the
corresponding field must also be set. No. is the primary key and unique, but there could
be more records in the Item table with the same Description. The **OnAfterLookup**

trigger looks up the chosen record and returns it in a RecordRef.

```
AL
```
```
table 37 "Sales Line"
{
// Skipped
fields
{
// Skipped
field( 6 ; "No."; Code[ 20 ])
{
TableRelation = Item;
}
field( 11 ; Description; Text[ 100 ])
{
TableRelation = Item.Description;
ValidateTableRelation = false;
}
```
```
// Skipped
}
}
```
```
page 46 "Sales Order Subform"
{
SourceTable = "Sales Line";
```
```
layout
{
area(content)
{
repeater(Control1)
{
// Skipped
```
```

# OnAction (Action) trigger

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Runs when a user selects an action on a page.

```
AL
```
This is called after the action properties, such as the RunObject Property, are invoked.

You typically use the RunObject Property to run objects such as pages, reports,
codeunits, and queries from an action. You can use the **OnAction** trigger when you
require more processing than the RunObject Property can support, such as filtering data
before a page is displayed or writing to the database.

```
The OnAction trigger is not used on Role Center pages. If you add AL code to the
trigger, the Role Center page will compile, but the AL code will be ignored at
runtime.

# OnPostReport (Report) trigger

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Runs after a report is run.

```
AL
```
This trigger is run after all data items are processed. The trigger is not run if the report
was stopped manually or by using the Quit before processing had concluded.

Because this trigger is run after the report is processed, you can use it to inform users
about the result of the report run. For example, if some records could not be processed,
you could inform the user of this using the following code in this trigger.

```
AL
```
Create the following global text constant variable.

```
Text constant ENU value
Text000 '%1 records were not processed'
```
Because this trigger is run before the End Write Transaction, you can also give the user
the opportunity to roll back changes to the database by leaving the report with the Quit
Method (Report, XMLport).

## Syntax

```
trigger OnPostReport()
begin
...
end;
```
## Remarks

```
if ProblemsInReport then
Message(Text000, NumberOfErrors);

# OnPreDataItem (Report Data Item)

# trigger

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Runs before a data item is processed.

```
AL
```
This trigger is run before a data item is processed, but after the associated variable is
initialized and table views and filters are set.

You can use this trigger to add additional filtering beyond what is established by the
DataItemLink Property (Reports) or DataItemTableView Property. For example, use this
trigger if you need to filter an indented data item based on the result of a calculation.
Use the SetRange Record or SetFilter Record to add extra delimiters.

# OnAfterGetRecord (Report Data Item)

# trigger

Article•08/26/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Runs each time a record is retrieved from the data item.

```
AL
```
Use this trigger to perform any processing that is needed, based on the values in the
fields of the individual records of a data item.

If the record contains FlowFields, you can put CalcFields Method (Record) statements in
this trigger to have them calculated. While it is normally easier to use the CalcFields
Property to have it done automatically, there are situations where you have to use this
trigger to perform the calculation explicitly. For example, if you apply FlowFilters based
on the context of the report or the XMLport to the FlowFields inside this trigger, you
need to recalculate the FlowFields after you have applied the FlowFilters.

Another example is when you need to retrieve information from a table that is external
to the report or XMLport. This is the situation when the records of a data item contain
fields that are foreign keys (that is, fields that are primary keys in other tables), and you
want to extract further information from the related tables. For example, in a report, the
records in a data item might contain a field with a Vendor code, while you want to print
the full name and address of the vendor. You use this trigger to retrieve the information
in order to print it in your report.

```
trigger OnAfterGetRecord()

# trigger

Article•10/01/2024

This trigger runs after the last record in the data item is processed but before the
OnPostReport Trigger or the OnPostXMLport Trigger is executed, if it is the last data
item of the report or XMLport.

Use this trigger to perform any cleanup or post processing needed after a data item is
processed. For example, if you create a non-printing report where records are updated,
you can update all the records with the modification date like shown in the example
below.

# OnBeforeOpen (Query) trigger

Article•10/01/2024

```
Version : Available or changed with runtime version 1.0.
```
Runs before a query is run and the dataset is generated.

```
AL
```
The AL code of a query object includes the **OnBeforeOpen** trigger that you can use to
change the data that will be included in the resulting dataset. For example, you can use
the **OnBeforeOpen** trigger to apply filters to a column.

The **OnBeforeOpen** trigger only supports local variables; global variables are not
supported.

The following code applies a filter on the Quantity column of the query by calling the
SetFilter on the **OnBeforeOpen** trigger of the query object.

```
AL
```
## Syntax

```
trigger OnBeforeOpen()
begin
...
end;
```
## Remarks

```
７ Note
```
```
A query cannot be run from the OnBeforeOpen trigger. You cannot call methods
from the triggers that run the query, such as Open , SaveAsXml , Read , or Close
methods.
```
